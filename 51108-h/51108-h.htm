<p>Pupils in public schools on declamation days are limited to five minutes
each for the delivery of "pieces." There is a great complaint of the scarcity
of material for such a purpose, while the injudicious pruning of eloquent
extracts has often marred the desired effects. To obviate these difficulties,
new "Five-Minute" books have been prepared by a competent teacher.</p>

<h2>THE YANKEE AND THE DUTCHMAN'S
DOG.</h2>


<p>Hiram was a quiet, peaceable sort of a Yankee, who lived
on the same farm on which his fathers had lived before
him, and was generally considered a pretty cute sort of a
fellow,&mdash;always ready with a trick, whenever it was of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
least utility; yet, when he did play any of his tricks, 'twas
done in such an innocent manner, that his victim could do
no better than take it all in good part.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that one of Hiram's neighbors sold a
farm to a tolerably green specimen of a Dutchman,&mdash;one of
the real unintelligent, stupid sort.</p>

<p>Von Vlom Schlopsch had a dog, as Dutchmen often have,
who was less unintelligent than his master, and who had,
since leaving his "faderland," become sufficiently civilized
not only to appropriate the soil as common stock, but had
progressed so far in the good work as to obtain his dinners
from the neighbors' sheepfold on the same principle.</p>

<p>When Hiram discovered this propensity in the canine department
of the Dutchman's family, he walked over to his
new neighbor's to enter complaint, which mission he accomplished
in the most natural method in the world.</p>

<p>"Wall, Von, your dog Blitzen's been killing my sheep."</p>

<p>"Ya! dat ish bace&mdash;bad. He ish von goot tog: ya! dat
ish bad!"</p>

<p>"Sartain, it's bad; and you'll have to stop 'im."</p>

<p>"Ya! dat ish allas goot; but ich weis nicht."</p>

<p>"What's that you say? <em>he was niched?</em> Wall, now look
here, old feller! nickin's no use. Crop 'im; cut the tail off
close, chock up to his trunk: that'll cure him."</p>

<p>"Vat ish dat?" exclaimed the Dutchman, while a faint
ray of intelligence crept over his features. "Ya! dat ish
goot. Dat cure von sheep steal, eh?"</p>

<p>"Sartain it will: he'll never touch sheep-meat again in
this world," said Hiram gravely.</p>

<p>"Den come mit me. He von mity goot tog; all the way
from Yarmany: I not take one five dollar&mdash;but come mit
me, and hold his tail, eh? Ich chop him off."</p>

<p>"Sartain," said Hiram: "I'll hold his tail if you want me
tew; but you must cut it up close."</p>

<p>"Ya! dat ish right. Ich make 'im von goot tog. There,
Blitzen, Blitzen! come right here, you von sheep steal rashcull:
I chop your tail in von two pieces."</p>

<p>The dog obeyed the summons; and the master tied his
feet fore and aft, for fear of accident, and, placing the tail
in the Yankee's hand, requested him to lay it across a large
block of wood.</p>

<p>"Chock up," said Hiram, as he drew the butt of the tail
close over the log.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ya! dat ish right. Now, you von tief sheep, I learns
you better luck," said Von Vlom Schlopsch, as he raised the
axe.</p>

<p>It descended; and, as it did so, Hiram, with characteristic
presence of mind, gave a sudden jerk, and brought Blitzen's
neck over the log; and the head rolled over the other side.</p>

<p>"Wall, I swow!" said Hiram with apparent astonishment,
as he dropped the headless trunk of the dog: "that
was a <em>leetle</em> too close."</p>

<p>"Mine cootness!" exclaimed the Dutchman, "<em>you shust
cut 'im off de wrong end</em>!"</p>

<h2>"WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THAT
NOSE?"</h2>


<p>Snyder kept a beer-saloon some years ago "over the
Rhine." Snyder was a ponderous Teuton of very irascible
temper,&mdash;"sudden and quick in quarrel,"&mdash;get mad in a
minute. Nevertheless his saloon was a great resort for the
boys,&mdash;partly because of the excellence of his beer, and
partly because they liked to chafe "old Snyder" as they
called him; for, although his bark was terrific, experience
had taught them that he wouldn't bite.</p>

<p>One day Snyder was missing; and it was explained by his
"frau," who "jerked" the beer that day, that he had
"gone out fishing mit der poys." The next day one of the
boys, who was particularly fond of "roasting" old Snyder,
dropped in to get a glass of beer, and discovered Snyder's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
nose, which was a big one at any time, swollen and blistered
by the sun, until it looked like a dead-ripe tomato.</p>

<p>"Why, Snyder, what's the matter with your nose?" said
the caller.</p>

<p>"I peen out fishing mit der poys," replied Snyder, laying
his finger tenderly against his proboscis: "the sun it
pes hot like ash der tifel, unt I purns my nose. Nice nose,
don't it?" And Snyder viewed it with a look of comical
sadness in the little mirror back of his bar. It entered at
once into the head of the mischievous fellow in front of
the bar to play a joke upon Snyder; so he went out and collected
half a dozen of his comrades, with whom he arranged
that they should drop in at the saloon one after another, and
ask Snyder, "What's the matter with that nose?" to see
how long he would stand it. The man who put up the job
went in first with a companion, and, seating themselves at a
table called for beer. Snyder, brought it to them; and the
new-comer exclaimed as he saw him, "Snyder, what's the
matter with your nose?"</p>

<p>"I yust dell your frient here I peen out fishin' mit der poys,
unt the sun he purnt 'em&mdash;zwi lager&mdash;den cents&mdash;all right."</p>

<p>Another boy rushes in. "Halloo, boys, you're ahead of
me this time: s'pose I'm in, though. Here, Snyder, bring
me a glass of lager and a pret"&mdash;(appears to catch a sudden
glimpse of Snyder's nose, looks wonderingly a moment, and
then bursts out laughing)&mdash;"ha! ha! ha! Why, Snyder,&mdash;ha!&mdash;ha!&mdash;what's
the matter with that nose?"</p>

<p>Snyder, of course, can't see any fun in having a burnt
nose or having it laughed at; and he says, in a tone sternly
emphatic,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've peen out fishing mit der poys, unt de sun it juse as
hot like ash dar tifel, unt I purnt my nose; dat ish all right."</p>

<p>Another tormentor comes in, and insists on "setting 'em
up" for the whole house. "Snyder," says he, "fill up the
boys' glasses, and take a drink yourse&mdash;&mdash;ho! ho! ho! ho!
ha! ha! ha! Snyder, wha&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;what's the matter
with that nose?"</p>

<p>Snyder's brow darkens with wrath by this time, and his
voice grows deeper and sterner,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I peen out fishin' mit der poys on der Leedle Miami.
De sun pese hot like as&mdash;vel, I purn my pugle. Now,
that is more vot I don't got to say. Vot gind o' peseness?
Dat ish all right; I purn my own nose, don't it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Burn your nose,&mdash;burn all the hair off your head, for
what I care; you needn't get mad about it."</p>

<p>It was evident that Snyder wouldn't stand more than one
more tweak at that nose; for he was tramping about behind
his bar, and growling like an exasperated old bear in his
cage. Another one of his tormentors walks in. Some one
sings out to him, "Have a glass of beer, Billy?"</p>

<p>"Don't care about any beer," says Billy, "but, Snyder,
you may give me one of your best ciga&mdash;Ha-a-a! ha! ha!
ha! ho! ho! ho! he! he! he! ah-h-h-ha! ha! ha! ha! Why&mdash;why&mdash;Snyder&mdash;who&mdash;who&mdash;ha-ha!
ha! what's the
matter with that nose?"</p>

<p>Snyder was absolutely fearful to behold by this time; his
face was purple with rage, all except his nose, which glowed
like a ball of fire. Leaning his ponderous figure far over the
bar, and raising his arm aloft to emphasize his words with
it, he fairly roared,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've been out fishin' mit ter poys. The sun it pese hot
like ash never vas. I purnt my nose. Now you no like
dose nose, you yust take yose nose unt wr-wr-wr-wring your
mean American finger mit em! That's the kind of man vot
I am!"</p>

<p>And Snyder was right.</p>

<p>"But he was worritin' the wee lambs o' the flock."</p>

<p>Here the De'il knockit hard an' strong. "Dugald Moir,
Wat ha'e a dog o' his ain. Ca' him up, an' treat him to a
bit o' poisoned meat. That wad ainly be tit for tat."</p>

<p>"Nay, again, Mister De'il. Wat's dog Bruce ance fished
my bairn oot o' the burn. He's a bra' beast, an' weel worth
twa o' puir, meddlin' Speed."</p>

<p>"But that wad ainly mak' your revenge completer."</p>

<p>"I willna tak' revenge. I'll do Wat sum gude turn i' place
o' it. I maun heap coals o' fire on his head."</p>

<p>Then the De'il knockit ance mair. "Dugald Moir, I
thocht you a mon o' spirit! You'll be the butt o' the country-side.
Get even wi' Wat Birney while you ca'. It isna
yet too late. He's cumin' up the glen. Speed's killin' was
an insult; wipe it oot wi' your fists."</p>

<p>"But sister Bel luvs the lad. He'll be my ain brither
sune. I wauna lift a han' to my brither."</p>

<p>"Whist! ha's nae mair your brither than I!"</p>

<p>"Nay, an' thank God for that las'! Gang awa'. You
canna enter the heart o' Dugald Moir."</p>

<p>There was a knock at the hoose door just then; an' Wat
Birney hissel' entered, wi' Bruce at his heels. Puir Speed
lay deid between us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"W'at wad you ha'e?" I asked, stern-loike, for the De'il
was batterin's awa' at my heart's door.</p>

<p>The lad held oot his han'. "I ha'e cam' to mak' peace.
We maun be friends."</p>

<p>But I turned awa' i' anger. "We canna. Dinna ask
it."</p>

<p>Ay, but the De'il was knockit fas' an' loud then. But
Wat Birney cud not ken.</p>

<p>"Bruce ha'e cam' to tak' Speed's place," he said.</p>

<p>It was a bra' giftie, but I wadna heed. "I dinna want
him," I cried. "Bring Speed bac' to life&mdash;if you ca'."</p>

<p>"I wish I cud, mon, for Bel's sake. We mauna quarrel."</p>

<p>"Knockit him doon!" shouted the De'il, shrill as a bagpipe.</p>

<p>I lifted my arm; but Wat was such a slender lad, I cudna
strike.</p>

<p>"Dinna you do it, Dugald. I canna forgi'e a blow," he
said. "I kilt puir Speed, but I'm baith ready an' willin' to
gi'e you Bruce i' his stead. It will ainly be a fair exchange.
Here's the colley, an' my han' on it. Cum, naybor, what
say you?"</p>

<p>"Say you willna ha'e his beast or his friendship," whispered
the De'il, peerin' i' through my heart's window.</p>

<p>An' I said it.</p>

<p>There were tears i' honest Wat's blu' een. "I'm sair
fashed, Dugald. I canna gae hame wi'oot your forgi'eness.
It's w'at I cam' for, an' I maun ha'e it. Dinna you min' the
day I picht Jeanie oot o' the burn? Ha'e you forgotten
that, mon? Bruce an' I togither saved the lassie's life."</p>

<p>"Speed's murder ha'e crosst that oot," I cried.</p>

<p>The De'il was for climbin' richt i' then, but I kept him
bac' wi' my next words. "Wat Birney, I may forgi'e you i'
time, but it will ainly be for Bel's sake. Gang awa'. The
De'il is at wark. I'm nae my ainsel' this nicht. Tak' puir
Speed oot, an' bury him. I canna."</p>

<p>The lad fell doon at my feet. "I maun ha'e your forgi'eness
first, Dugald Moir. Bel loves us baith, an' we maun
love each ither. Say the word noo; say, Wat, it's a' forgi'en
an' forgotten." I thocht o' bonnie sister Bel, an' said
the words owre; but my heart wasna i' them.</p>

<p>"You dinna mean it," said Wat sadly; "but I'll bury
Speed a' the same."</p>

<p>Then he went oot, draggin' the deid beast after him. I fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>lowed
a' unnoticed. Doon i' the glen he dug Speed's grave,
an' laid the colley i' it. When he had finished, he knelt
aboon it, an' just prayed aloud.</p>

<p>"Lord, forgi'e this day's hasty deed, an' help Dugald Moir
to forgi'e it too. He's sair angry wi' me, an' nae wi'oot
cause. But thee kens dog Speed weel earned my bullet.
Ainly an hour sin he mangled two o' my best Sou'-Downs.
But Dugald's hate is worse than a'. I maun ha'e the mon's
love an' friendship."</p>

<p>The De'il ga've a great boun' and left my heart's door as
I rushed roun' to Wat's side.</p>

<p>"You shall ha'e baith frae this minit," I cried. An' then
my arm stole 'boot the lad's neck, juist as I had seen Bel's
do on mony a moonlit nicht. He looked at me, bewildered.</p>

<p>"I didna dream you wod hear. But it's juist God's ain
gude answer. An' noo you'll tak' Bruce i' Speed's place."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said; for the De'il had vanished.</p>

<p>Slowly we walked bac' to the hoose. Bel met us wi'
a kiss for baith, her black een beamin' wi' love and gladness.</p>

<p>She wedded Wat sune after, an' for forty lang years he
ha'e been a bra', true brither. The De'il hasna visited me
sin'.</p>

<span class="i0">A Frenchman once, who was a merry wight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passing to town from Dover, in the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near the roadside an alehouse chanced to spy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And being rather tired, as well as dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved to enter; but first he took a peep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hopes a supper he might get, and cheap.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He enters. "Hallo, garçon, if you please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring me a leetel bit of bread and cheese,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hallo, garçon, a pot of porter, too!" he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Vich I shall take, and den myself to bed."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His supper done, some scraps of cheese were left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which our poor Frenchman, thinking it no theft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into his pocket put; then slowly crept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wished-for bed. But not a wink he slept;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For on the floor some sacks of flour were laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which the rats a nightly visit paid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hero now undressed, popped out the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put on his cap, and bade the world good-night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first his breeches, which contained the fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under his pillow he had placed with care.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i lang="fr">Sans ceremonie</i>, soon the rats all ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the flour-sacks greedily began,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Under the pillow soon the cheese they found;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, while at this they all regaling sat,<br /></span>

<h2>THE SOLEMN BOOK-AGENT.</h2>


<p>He was tall, solemn, and dignified. One would have
thought him a Roman senator on his way to make a speech
on finance. But he wasn't, singularly enough, he wasn't.
He was a book-agent. He wore a linen duster; and his
brow was furrowed with many care-lines, as if he had been
obliged to tumble out of bed every other night of his life to
dose a sick child. He called into a tailor-shop on Randolph
Street, removed his hat, took his "Lives of Eminent Philosophers"
from its cambric bag, and approached the tailor
with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'd like to have you look at this rare work."</p>

<p>"I haf no time," replied the tailor.</p>

<p>"It is a work which every thinking man should delight to
peruse," continued the agent.</p>

<p>"Zo?" said the tailor.</p>

<p>"Yes. It is a work on which a great deal of deep thought
has been expended; and it is pronounced by such men as
Wendell Phillips to be a work without a rival in modern
literature."</p>

<p>"Makes anybody laugh when he zees it?" asked the
tailor.</p>

<p>"No, my friend: this is a deep, profound work, as I have
already said. It deals with such characters as Theocritus,
Socrates, and Plato, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. If you
desire a work on which the most eminent author of our day
has spent years of study and research, you can find nothing
to compare with this."</p>

<p>"Does it shpeak about how to glean cloze?" anxiously
asked the man of the goose.</p>

<p>"My friend, this is no receipt-book, but an eminent work
on philosophy, as I have told you. Years were consumed in
preparing this volume for the press; and none but the
clearest mind could have grasped the subjects herein discussed.
If you desire food for deep meditation, you have it
here."</p>

<p>"Does dis pook say sumding about der Prussian war?"
asked the tailor as he threaded his needle.</p>

<p>"My friend, this is not an every-day book, but a work on
philosophy,&mdash;a work which will soon be in the hands of
every profound thinker in the country. What is the art of
philosophy? This book tells you. Who were, and who are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
our philosophers? Turn to these pages for a reply. As I
said before, I don't see how you can do without it."</p>

<p>"And he don't haf any dings about some fun, eh?"
inquired the tailor, as the book was held to him.</p>

<p>"My friend, must I again inform you that this is not an
ephemeral work, not a collection of nauseous trash, but a
rare, deep work on philosophy? Here, see the name of the
author. That name alone should be proof enough to your
mind, that the work cannot be surpassed for profundity of
thought. Why, sir, Gerritt Smith testifies to the greatness
of this volume!"</p>

<p>"I not knows Mr. Schmidt: I make no cloze mit him,"
returned the tailor in a doubting voice.</p>

<p>"Then you will let me leave your place without having
secured your name to this volume? I cannot believe it.
Behold, what research! Turn these leaves, and see these
gems of richest thought! Ah! if we only had such minds,
and could wield such a pen! But we can read, and, in a
measure, we can be like him. Every family should have
this noble work. Let me put your name down: the book is
only twelve dollars."</p>

<p>"Zwelve dollars for der pook! Zwelve dollars, und he
has noddings about der war, und no fun in him, or say
noddings how to get glean cloze! What you take me for,
mister? Go right away mit dat pook, or I call der bolice,
and haf you locked up pooty quick!"</p>

Pfeiffer being busy negotiating with a city produce-dealer, on
his arrival, Schneider thought he would take a stroll in the
garden, and see some of his favorites in their pristine
beauty. We will let him tell the rest of his story in his
own language,&mdash;</p>

<h2>THE UNITED ORDER OF HALF-SHELLS.</h2>


<p>"My vhife all der time says to me, 'Carl Dunder, if you
vhas to be kilt by a butcher-cart or ice-wagon, or if some
shteamboat plow you oop on de river, I left mit no money.
Vhy doan' you pe insured mit your life?'</p>

<p>"Vhell, I tinks about dot a good deal. It vhas my duty
dot my vhife und Katie doan' go mit der poorhouse if I can
help it, und I tink it vhas pest to get some insurance. I
shpeak to my frendt, Shon Plazes, vhas about it, und Shon
he says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Of course you vhant insurance. You come into my
lodge of der United Order of Half-shells. Dot vhas an
order which only cost one dollar a year, und if you die your
family puts on shtyle mit der ten thousand dollar in greenpacks.
I calls a meeting right avhay mit your saloon, und
we put you through like some streaks of greased lightning.'</p>

<p>"Vhell, I goes home and tells der old vhomans, und she
says dot vhas O. K. She doan's like to see me die; but if
some shmall-pox or yellow-fever comes to Detroit, und takes
me avay, she likes to haf a long funeral procession, und build
me a grave-stone vhich reads dot Carl Dunder vhas a goot
husband, a kind fadder, und dot he vhas gone to heaven only
a leedle vhile before he vhas ready. I shpeak to my daughter
Katie, und she sheds some tears und dells me dot she
looks as cute as an angel in some mourning gloze for me.
So it vhas all right, und I sweep out my saloon, und about
twenty men come in dot eafnings to make me a Half-shell.</p>

<p>"Oxcuse me if I vhas madt, und use some words like a
pirate. My frendt, Shon Plazes, vas dhere mit a red cap on
his head, und a voice so solemn dot I feels chills go up my
pack. He calls de meeting to order, and says I like to
shoine and become a Half-shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Does he like peer?' asks some mans in the gorner.</p>

<p>"'He does,' said Shon Plazes.</p>

<p>"'Und so do we!' yells all der meeting, and Shon says
I was to come down mit der peer. Dot was nineteen
glasses.</p>

<p>"Den Shon Plazes, he reads from a pook mit a plue cover
dot man vhas dying efery day so fast dot you can't count
'em, or somedins like dot, und he calls oudt,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Vhat shall safe dis man?'</p>

<p>"Und eaferpody yells, 'Lager peer!' Dot means, I set
him oop again, und dot vhas nineteen glasses more. Den
two men take me und vhalk me all aroundt, und Shon Plazes
he cries oudt,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Ve vhas here to-day und gone to-morrow! In der midnight,
when eaferpody vhas ashleep, a tief comes und shteals
our life away! Vhat keeps dot tief afar off?'</p>

<p>"Und eaferpody groans oudt like he vhas dying, 'Cool
lager!' Dot means I was to set 'em oop again, und dot
vhas nineteen glasses more. Den Shon Plazes he leads me
twice around und says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Carl Dunder, you tinks you vhas made a Half-shell already,
but you vhas mistaken. Put out your left handt.
Dot vhas goot. Now, my frendt, vhat vas der foundation
stone of liberty, equality, und brotection?'</p>

<p>"Und eaferpody lifs oop his voice und groans out, 'All
der lager a man vhants!' Dot means, I vhas to tap a fresh
keg; und I believe dot growd drinks more as forty glasses.
I doan' like it so previous like. I didn't, but my frendt
Shon Plazes tells me to lie down on der table on my pack,
und shut my eyes. Vhen I vhas in bosition he hit me three
dimes mit his fist in der stomach, und cries oudt,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Vhen he vhas alife he vhas kind mit der boor; vhen he
vhas death, we forgot his faults. Brudders, vhat vhas der
great brinciple dot leads to charity und penevolence?'</p>

<p>"Und eaferpody shumps to his feet und yells out, 'Some
more lager and cigars!' Vhell, I set 'em oop once more, und
den I vhas so madt dot I take my glub und clean dot crowd
oudt mit der street. I belief he vas a fraud on me. I belief
Shon Plazes tells all der poys, und it vhas a put-up shob. I
lose my peer and cigars, und somebody carries off more as
ten bottles of vhiskey from my par, und I vhas no more a
Half-shell as yoo are. If dot vhas some vhey to insure me
so dat my vhife und Katie haf some mourning goods, und<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
puy me a grave-stone mit a lamp on top, I go out of pollytics

<h2>WHY NO SCOTCHMEN GO TO HEAVEN.</h2>


<p>Long years ago, in time so remote that history does not
fix the epoch, a dreadful war was waged by the king of Scotland.
Scottish valor prevailed; and the king of Scotland,
elated by success, sent for his prime minister.</p>

<p>"Weel, Sandy," said he, "is there ne'er a king we canna
conquer noo?"</p>

<p>"An it please your majesty, I ken o' a king that your
majesty canna vanquish."</p>

<p>"An' who is he, Sandy?"</p>

<p>The prime minister, reverently looking up, said, "The
King o' heaven."</p>

<p>"The king of whaur, Sandy?"</p>

<p>"The King o' heaven."</p>

<p>The Scottish king did not understand, but was unwilling
to exhibit any ignorance.</p>

<p>"Just gang your ways, Sandy, and tell King o' heaven
to gi'e up his dominions, or I'll come mysel' and ding him
oot o' them; and mind you, Sandy, you dinna come back to
us until ye ha'e dune oor biddin'."</p>

<p>The prime minister retired much perplexed, but met a
priest, and, re-assured, returned and presented himself.</p>

<p>"Weel, Sandy," said the king, "ha'e ye seen the King o'
heaven? and what says he to our biddin'?"</p>

<p>"An it please your majesty, I ha'e seen one o' his accredited
ministers."</p>

<p>"Weel, and what says he?"</p>

<p>"He says your majesty may e'en ha'e his kingdom for the
axin' o' it."</p>

<p>"Was he sae civil?" asked the king, warming to magnanimity.
"Just gang your ways back, Sandy, an' tell the
King o' heaven that for his civility the de'il a Scotchman
shall set foot in his kingdom."</p>

<h2>A DUTCHMAN'S ANSWER.</h2>


<p>Bill Jones was going to get married a day or two ago,
and he forgot whar de minister libed; so he started to find
him out, so as to hab him come to de house an' perform de
marriage ceremony. So, arter getting along down de road
for two or free miles, he became fearful ob gettin' on de
wrong track. So he says to a big Dutchman "I say, can
you tell me where Mr. Swackelhammer, de preacher, lives?"
and de Dutchman said, "Yaw. You just valk de road up
to de creek, an' down de pritch over up shtreme, den you
just go on till you cum to a road what vinds de woots
around a schoolhouse; but you don't take dat road. Vell,
den you go on till you meet a pig-pen shingled mit straw,
den you durn de road round de field, and go on till you
come to pig red house. Den you turn dat house around de
barn, and see a road dat goes up in de woots. Den you
don't take dat road too. Den you go straight on, and de
fust house you meet is a hay-stack, and de next is a barrack.
Vell, he don't live dere. Den you will get a little
furder, and you see a house on top de hill, about a mile;
and you go in dere an' ax de old voman, an' she will tell
you bedder as I can."</p>

<h2>THE VAY RUBE HOFFENSTEIN SELLS.</h2>


<p>"Herman," said a Poydras street merchant clothier,
addressing his clerk, "haf ye sold all of dose overgoats vat
vas left over from last vinter?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; dere vas dree of dem left yet."</p>

<p>"Vell, ye must sell 'em right avay, as de vinter vill not
last, you know, Herman. Pring me one uf de goats and I
vill show you somedings about de pisness. I vill dell you
how ve vill sell dem out, und you must learn de pisness,
Herman; de vinter vas gone, you know, und ve hav had
dose goats in de store more as seex years."</p>

<p>An eight-dollar overcoat was handed him by his clerk,
and smoothing it out, he took a buckskin money purse from
the showcase, and, stuffing it full of paper, dropped it into
one of the pockets.</p>

<p>"How, Herman, my poy," he continued," vatch me sell
dat coat. I haf sold over dirty-fife uf dem shust de same
vay, und I vant to deech you de pisness. Ven de next
gustomer comes in de shop I vill show de vay Rube Hoffenstein,
my broder in Detroit, sells his cloding and udder
dings."</p>

<p>A few minutes later a negro, in quest of a pair of suitable
cheap shoes, entered the store. The proprietor advanced
smiling, and inquired:</p>

<p>"Vat is it you vish?"</p>

<p>"Yer got any cheap shoes hyar?" asked the negro.</p>

<p>"Blenty of dem, my frent, blenty; at any price you vant."</p>

<p>The negro stated that he wanted a pair of brogans, and
soon his pedal extremities were encased in them, and a
bargain struck. As he was about to leave, the proprietor
called him back.</p>

<p>"I ain't gwine ter buy nuffin else. I'se got all I want,"
said the negro, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Dot may be so, my dear sir," replied the proprietor,
"but I shust vants you to look at dis goat. It vas de pure
Russian vool, und dis dime last year you doan got dot same
goat for dwenty-five dollars. Mine gracious, clothing vos
gone down to noding, and dere vas no money in de pisness

Canal streed, took that goat home mit him yesterday, and
vore it all day, but it vas a leetle dight agross de shoulders,
und he brought it pack shust a vile ago. Dry it on, my dear
sir. Ah! dot vas all right. Mister Jones vas a rich man,
and he liked dot goat. How deep de pockets vas, but it vas
a leetle dight agross de shoulders."</p>

<p>The negro buttoned up the coat, thrust his hands in the
pockets, and felt the purse. A peaceful smile played over
his face when his touch disclosed to his mind the contents
of the pockets, but he choked down his joy and inquired:</p>

<p>"Who did you say wore this hyar coat?"</p>

<p>"Vy, Mister Jones vot owns de bank on Canal streed."</p>

<p>"What yer gwine to ax fur it?"</p>

<p>"Dwenty dollars."</p>

<p>"Dat's powerful high price fur dis coat, but I'll take it."</p>

<p>"Herman, here, wrap up dis goat fur the schentleman,
and throw in a cravat; it will make him look nice mit de
ladies."</p>

<p>"Nebber mind, I'll keep the coat on," replied the negro,
and pulling out a roll of money, he paid for it and left the
store.</p>

<p>While he was around the next corner moaning over the
stuffed purse, Hoffenstein said to his clerk:</p>

<p>"Herman, fix up anudder von of dose goats de same vay,

<h2>MR. HOFFENSTEIN'S BUGLE.</h2>

of pants, and placed them on a pile, "if you don't haf any
objections, I vould like to get from de store avay von efening,
und go mit de soldiers to de Spanish Fort."</p>

<p>"Vell, Herman, I dinks you had better keep avay from de

you know, you don't can put any confidence mit de
soldiers&mdash;I vill tell you vhy. Von day, vile I vas in Vicksburg

an old bugle in his hand, und he looks around. I asks him
vat he vants, und he buys a couple of undershirts; den
he tells me to keep his bundle and his bugle behind de
counter until he comes back. After de cock-eyed soldier
vent de store out, some more soldiers come in und valk all
around, vile dey look at de goods. 'Shentlemens,' I says, 'do
you vant anydings?'&mdash;'Ve are shust looking to see vat you

shust look dere at de bugle! de very ding de captain told us
to get. You know ve don't haf any bugle in de company for
dree months.&mdash;How much you ask for dot bugle?' I dells
dem dot I don't can sell de bugle, because it belongs to a man
vat shust vent oud. 'I vill gif you fifty dollars for it,' says
de soldier, pulling his money oud. I dells him I don't can
sell it, because it vasn't mine. 'I vill gif you one hundred
dollars,' he said. Mine gr-r-acious! Herman, I vants to sell
de bugle so bad dot I vistles. De soldiers dells me, vile dey
vas leaving de store, dot if I buy de bugle from de man vot
owns it, dey vill gif me one hundred und dwendy-five dollars
for it. I dells dem I vill do it. I sees a chance, you know,
Herman, to make some money py the oberation. Ven de
cock-eyed soldier comes back he says, 'Gif me my bundle
und bugle; I got to go to de camp.' I says, 'Mine frent,
don't you vant to sell your bugle?' He dells me no, und I
says, 'My little boy, Leopold, vot plays in de store, sees de
bugle, und he goes all around crying shust so loud as he can,
because he don't get it. Six times I takes him in de yard
und vips him, und he comes right back und cries for de
bugle. It shows, you know, how much drouble a man vill
haf mit a family. I vill gif you den dollars for it, shust to
please little Leopold.' De soldier von't dake it; und at last
I offer him fifty dollars, und he says, 'Vell, I vill dake fifty
dollars, because I can't vaste any more time: I haf to go to
de camp.' Afder he goes avay, I goes to de door, und vatches
for de soldiers vat vanted de bugle. I sees dem passing
along de street, und I says, 'My frents, I haf got de bugle;'
und dey say, 'Vell, hang it! vy don't you blow it?' Mine
gr-r-acious! Herman, vat you dink? All dem soldiers belong
to de same crowd, und dey make de trick to swindle me.
Levi Cohen, across de street, he finds it out, und efery day
he gets boys to blow horns in front of mine store, so as to
make me dink how I vas swindled. Herman, I dink you
had better stay mit de store."</p>

<h2>TICKLED ALL OAFER.</h2>


<p>The Chief of Police yesterday had a visit from an old
farmer living out on the Center Line road, who had a story
to tell. After two or three efforts, he began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I vhas goin home, last night, ven I overtakes two men
on der roadt. Dose fellers dey laft, und saidt would I gif
'em a ride? I laft, too, und say, 'shump in.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand."</p>

<p>"Pooty queek one feller laft, und saidt he likes Dutchmens,
'cause his uncle vas a Dutchmans. Dot vhas all
right, und so I laft, too. I vhas real tickled, und I shakes
all oafer."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In a leetle vhile one feller vhants me to shange a seven-tollar
bill, so as he could gif some money to der orphan
assylums; und he lafts, ha! ha! ha! Dot tickled me some
more, und I lafts too. Den de odder feller, he grabs me py
der collar und pulls me down behind, und says dey looks in
my pockets for a shteampoat dot vos stolen from Detroit.
Dot makes us all laff, like some goot shoke."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must have been funny."</p>

<p>"It vhas. Dose fellers took out my wallet and counted
oop der monish. I had shust ten tollar; und dey laft, und
said dot dey must go on some trips to der seashore mit dot.
Dot tickled me some more, und I laft, too."</p>

<p>"Well, what then?"</p>

<p>"Vhell, den dey shumped oud, und put deir fingers on der
noses, und says, 'Goot-py, old Dutchmans,' und avhay dey
goes like some horse-races."</p>

<p>"And you didn't laugh at that?"</p>

<p>"Vhell, not pooty much. I vhas all ready to, but I
shtopped. If dem fellers vhas up to shokes, it was all
right; but if they vhas robbers, I vhants you to catch 'em,

<h2>AN ERROR O' JUDGMENT.</h2>


<p>We are a quiet, law-abiding people doon here in Saltcoats.
Indeed, I havna seen a polisman for sax weeks, an' trooly
when I think o' hoo happy we a' are I'm aye reminded o'
the hundred and thirty-third Saum.</p>

<p>Being orderly folk, an' in oor beds at a proper oor, the
street-lamps are a' screwed oot every nicht at twal o'clock&mdash;an'
quite late eneuch tae, for if folk are no hame by that
time they should be. Oor gas, I may remark, is cheaper and
better than the Glasgow thing; altho' we don't make a great
wark aboot it bein' equal ta sae mony "caunle po'er," an'
ither nonsense o' that kin'. Bein' savin' folk, moreover, on
nichts when the mune's up the lamps are no lichtit at a'.
It wad be o' nae use, you see, an' a perfect throwin' awa o'
gas. But that brings me to what I was goin' tae say.</p>

<p>The ither nicht, though it wis vera dark, no a lamp was
lichtet, a matter that rather bothered the inhabitants. By-an'-by
a few o' the principal folk cam' doon tae my place
jist as I wis closin', an' after a bit crack we made up oor
mind tae gie a ca' on the lamplighter. The reg'lar man wis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
through at Kirkliston&mdash;he's East country himsel', if I don't
mistak he belangs tae Manuel&mdash;buryin' his wife's auntie;
so it wis jist, as ye micht say, a depute-proxy that wis daein'
the wark. Weel, we daunnert up tae this depute-proxy's
hoose; bit he wis in bed, on' a' oor chappin' at the door
couldna rouse him. Seein' this, we borrow't a lether, frae a
slater that steys next door, an' twa o' the ithers steadin' it,
I crept up the rungs an' twirlt at the window wi' my fingers,
singin' a' the time&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O are ye sleeping, Wullie!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O are ye sleeping, Wullie!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O are ye&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>"Whit ye oh-in' at?" cries Wullie, comin' tae the window:
"a body wid think it wis some lass you were serenadin'."</p>

<p>"Wullie," says I solemnly, "what's this ye hae been daein'
at a' at a'?"</p>

<p>"I've been daein' naething but sleepin': it's you that's
kicking up the row."</p>

<p>"But ye hivna lichtet the lamps the nicht."</p>

<p>"This is no my nicht: it's the mune the nicht."</p>

<p>"Surely ye've made a mistak, Wullie: there's nae mune
that I see."</p>

<p>"I've made nae mistak, for I lookit the almanac."</p>

<p>"But will ye no listen tae reason? Put yer heid oot an'
see for yersel'."</p>

<p>Wullie put his heid oot. "Woel," he says, "there's nae
mune, certainly; but ye surely widna hae me responsible for
that. I go by the almanac; an' if it says there's to be a
mune, it's a' one tae me whether there's nae mune or a million
o' munes, not a lamp will I licht."</p>

<p>"That's quite richt, Wullie: nae doot ye maun hae some
rule to go by&mdash;Gentlemen," I cries doon, "he has the best
o' the argument: what am I tae dae noo?"</p>

<p>"Haul him oot the window," they cried up.</p>

<p>"Oh! if ye're goin' tae begin fechtin' I'll come doon," I
replies, "and let some o' the rest o' ye up." But they cried,
that I'd better jist settle it when I wis there, so I says,
"Wullie, whit almanac d'ye go by? Is't Orr's, or the
Belfast?"</p>

<p>"Here it's up on the mantlepiece, ye can see it for yersel';"
and he took it doon, an' held it oot tae me, giein' me a cannle
at the same time to read it by. One look, hooever, explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the hale affair. "Gracious guidness, Wullie," I cries, "this
is last year's!"</p>

<p>"Eh! what! last year's?"</p>

<p>"It is that," says I.</p>

<p>"Mr Kaye," says Wullie, "don't say another word. Wait
a minute, an' I'll put on my troosers, an' in hauf an oor
every lamp'll be shinin' sae that ye wid think it wis a general
illumination."</p>

<p>He wis as guid as his word; an' we a' accompanied him on
his rounds, an' the cheers the laddies gied as each lamp wis
lichtet wid 'a' dune yer hert guid. We had a meetin' in the
coalree afterwards; an' I proposed that Wullie, for his strict
attention tae duty&mdash;it was only an error o' judgment he had
made, very different frae carelessness&mdash;should get the first
vacant place we had, at a guid wage; an' the motion wis
carried, an' Wullie an' us a' went hame happy.</p>

<h2>SOCKERY KADAHCUT'S KAT.</h2>


<p>Oh! I had de vorst dime lasd veek dot you effer saw.
Katrina (dot vos mine frau) vent avay to make a liddle bicnic,
und as I vas been hafin' de shake und agers und didn't
feel pooty goot, I shtayed to home.</p>

<p>Vell, as I vas valkin' arount de parn yart, I saw dot same
olt plue hen coom out from unter der parn sayin': "Kut,
kut, ka-dah-kut; kut, kut, ka-dah-kut," und dot puts me in
mint of a shoke dot Katrina mait on me von tay: she sait
dot I autto vas bin a olt rooster, cos de hens called me
effery dime ven day lait a aigs. Dot vas a pooty goot shoke
on me. Vell, as I vas saying, I saw dot olt plue hen coom
out from unter de parn, und I tought to myself, meppy dere
vas a nest of aigs unter dere; so I pull oud half a tozzen
more sdones, und mait a hole so pig as I can crawl unter,
und den as I vas crawlin' arount unter a lookin' for some
nest mit aigs, all at once I spiet de pootiest liddle kat vat I
effer seen; he vas all plack mit vite shtripes, und vas shnuggled
ub in a little pall fahst asleeb.</p>

<p>Vell, ve vas bin vantin' a kat because dere vas so many
mouses in de house, und I tought uf I kin git dot von I'll
make Katrina a little surbrise barty; so I krawl along so sdill
as never vas, till I got ub close to him, den I mait a grab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
und I ketched him by the neck so dot he dont kin pite me;
but ach, mine gootness, vat shmell, vorse as a huntred parrels
of limburgher! <em>I tought I had stepped on someding dot
vas deat, und proke him mit my knees.</em> I vas most shoke mit
dot shmell; but I held dot liddle kat up close to me und
klimb oud so kwick as I can. Ven I got oud in de parn yart,
dere vas pig Chake Moser goin' py, und ven he seen me,
he sait, "Sockery, you olt deutch fool, vot are you doin' mit
dot skunk?"&mdash;"Shkunk!" I sait, "I tought dot vas a liddle
kat;" und I drop him so quick like he was hot.</p>

<p>Vell, Chake, he laf like he vould kill himself; und I ask him
vot I kin do to git me off dot shmell. He sait dot de only ding
vas to be perried in de ground till de earth absorp de shmell;
und he sait he vould tig de hole und fix me in, if I vish.
Vell, I dink dot is very goot of Chake, und I tought if I can
get me dot shmell off before Katrina cooms home, I von't
say any ding about dot liddle kat to anypody. So Chake
dig de hole, und I sit down in it und vas perried up to de
neck; den Chake sait he vas in a hurry und he must go to
de willage, und he vent avay. Booty soon kwick a fly lite
on my face, und I koodn't prush him off, cos my arms vas
perried doo; und booty soon more as a hundret flies und
effery ding vas krawl all ofer my het, und I shpit and plow,
und vink my face dill I tink I vas gone crazy. Bimepy I

<h2>I VASH SO GLAD I VASH HERE!</h2>

<p class="center">A HUMOROUS RECITATION.</p>


<p>One who does not believe in immersion for baptism was
holding a protracted meeting, and one night preached on
the subject of baptism. In the course of his remarks he
said that some believe it necessary to go down into the
water, and come up out of it, to be baptized. But this he
claimed to be fallacy; for the preposition "into" of the
Scripture should be rendered differently, as it does not mean
<em>into</em> at all times. "Moses," he said, "we are told, went up
into the mountain; and the Saviour was taken up into a
high mountain, etc. Now, we do not suppose either went
into a mountain, but went unto it. So with going down
into the water: it means simply going down close by or near
to the water, and being baptized in the ordinary way by
sprinkling or pouring." He carried this idea out fully, and
in due season closed his discourse, when an invitation was
given for any one so disposed to rise and express his thoughts.
Quite a number of his brethren arose and said they were
glad they had been present on this occasion, that they were
well pleased with the sound sermon they had just heard,
and felt their souls greatly blessed. Finally, a corpulent
gentleman of Teutonic extraction, a stranger to all, arose
and broke the silence that was almost painful, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mister Breacher, I is so glad I vash here to-night, for I
has had explained to my mint some dings dat I neffer could
pelief before. Oh, I is so glad dat into does not mean into
at all, but shust close by or near to; for now I can pelief
many dings vot I could not pelief pefore. We reat, Mr.
Breacher, dat Taniel vash cast into de ten of lions, and came
out alife. Now I neffer could pelief dat, for wilet peasts
would shust eat him right off; but now it is fery clear to
my mint. He vash shust close py or near to, and tid not
get into de ten at all. Oh, I ish so glad I vash here to-night!
Again, we reat dat de Heprew children vash cast
into de firish furnace, and dat always look like a peeg story
too, for they would have been purnt up; but it ish all blain
to my mint now, for dey was shust cast py or close to de
firish furnace. Oh, I vash so glad I vash here to-night!
And den, Mr. Breacher, it ish said dat Jonah vash cast into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
de sea, and taken into de whale's pelly. Now I neffer could
pelief dat. It alwish seemed to me to be a peeg fish story,
but it ish all blain to my mint now. He vash not into de
whale's pelly at all, but shump onto his pack and rode
ashore. Oh, I vash so glad I vash here to-night!</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. Breacher, if you will shust exblain two
more bassages of Scriptures, I shall be oh, so happy dot I
vash here to-night. One of dem ish vere it saish de vicked
shall be cast into a lake dat burns mit fire and primstone
alwish. Oh, Mr. Breacher, shall I be cast into dat lake if I
am vicked, or shust close py or near to&mdash;shust near enough
to be comfortable? Oh, I hope you tell me I shall be cast
only shust py a good vays off, and I will pe so glad I vash
here to-night. De oder bassage is dat vich saish, blessed are
they who do these commandments, dat dey may have right
to de dree of life, and enter in droo de gates of de city, and
not shust close py or near to,&mdash;shust near enough to see vat
I have lost,&mdash;and I shall pe so glad I vash here to-night!"</p>

<h2>TEACHING HIM THE BUSINESS.</h2>


<p>"Herman," said a Poydras-street merchant clothier, addressing
his clerk, "haf ve sold all of dose overgoats vat vas
left over from last vinter?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; dere vas dree of dem left yet."</p>

<p>"Vell, ve must sell 'em right avay, as the vinter vill not
last, you know, Herman. Pring me one uf de goats und I
vill show you somedings about de pisness. I vill tell you
how we vill sell dem oud, und you must learn de bisness,
Hermann; de vinter vas gone, you know, und ve hav had
dose goats in de store more es seex years."</p>

<p>An eight-dollar overcoat was handed him by his clerk,
and, smoothing it out, he took a buckskin money-purse from
the showcase, and stuffing it full of paper, dropped it into
one of the pockets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Herman, my poy," he continued, "vatch me sell
dot goat. I haf sold over dirty-fife uv dem shust de same
vay, und I vant to deech you de pisness. Yen de nexd gustomer
comes in de shop I vill show de way Rube Hoffenstein,
mine broder in Detroit, sells his cloding und udder
dings."</p>

<p>A few minutes later a negro, in quest of a suitable pair of
cheap shoes, entered the store. The proprietor advanced
smiling, and inquired&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vat is it you vish?"</p>

<p>"Yer got any cheap shoes hyar?" asked the negro.</p>

<p>"Blenty uf dem, my frient, blenty; at any brice you vant."</p>

<p>The negro stated that he wanted a pair of brogans; and
soon his pedal extremities were encased in them, and a bargain
struck. As he was about to leave, the proprietor called
him back.</p>

<p>"I ain't gwine to buy nuffin' else. I'se got all I want,"
said the negro sullenly.</p>

<p>"Dot may be so, my dear sir," replied the proprietor, "but
I shust vants you to look at dis goat. It vas de pure Russian
wool, und dis dime last year you doan got dot same goat
for twenty-five dollars. Mine gracious! cloding vas gone
down to noding, and der vas no money in de pisness any
longer. You vant someding dot vill keep you from de vedder,
und make you feel varm as summer-dime. De gonsumption
vas going round, und de doctors dell me it vas de
vedder. More den nine beobles died round vere I lif last
week. Dink of dot! Mine frient, dot goat vas Russian
vool, dick und hevy. Vy, Misder Jones, who owns der pank
on Canal Streed, took dot goat home mit him yesterday, und
vore it all day; but it vas a leedle dight agross de shoulders,
und he brought it pack shust a vile ago. Dry it on, my
dear sir. Ah! dot vas all righd. Misder Jones vas a rich
man und he liked dot goat. How deep de pockets vas! but
it vas a leedle dight agross de shoulders."</p>

<p>The negro buttoned up the coat, thrust his hands in the
pockets and felt the purse. A peaceful smile played over
his face when his touch disclosed to his mind the contents of
the pockets, but he choked down his joy and inquired&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who did you say wore this hyar coat?"</p>

<p>"Vy, Misder Jones, vot owns de pank on Canal Streed.</p>

<p>"What yer gwine to ax for it?"</p>

<p>"Dwenty dollars."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dat's pow'ful high price fur dis coat, but I'll take it."</p>

<p>"Herman! here, wrap up this goat for de schentleman and
drow in a cravat; it vill make him look nice mit de ladies."</p>

<p>"Nebber mind, I'll keep de coat on," replied the negro;
and pulling out a roll of money he paid for it and left the
store.</p>

<p>While he was around the next corner moaning over the
stuffed purse, Hoffenstein said to his clerk:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Herman, fix up anudder vun of dose goats de same vay;
and doan forget to dell dem dot Misder Jones vot run de

<h2>HOW JAKE SCHNEIDER WENT BLIND.</h2>


<p>In Germantown, near Philadelphia, several years ago, a
native, simple-minded Dutchman, named Jacob Schneider,
kept a liquor and lager-beer saloon. Jacob was not only
fond of drinking lager with his customers, but would not
refuse either corn-juice, red-eye, or Jersey lightning, when
asked to imbibe thereof in a social way&mdash;the customer, of
course, paying an extra half-dime for Jacob's drink. One
would not suppose that this friendly habit could, by any
possibility, bring trouble and vexation upon honest Jacob;
but it did, as we shall presently show.</p>

<p>One eventful night it was observed that Schneider had
shut up his saloon and gone home full an hour earlier than
usual. Being asked, next day, what was the matter, he told
the following droll story:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shut up mine blace pecause I vas mat as ter tyfel, and
vas humpugged into der pargain. I'll tell you 'pout it. Yer
see, dree or four young shcamps gomes into mine saloon, and
one says to me, 'Yacob, you got some fresh lager?' I says
'yaas,' and I draws der lager; anoder von says he vants
gards, and I prings de gards, and da blays gards. Pimeby
noder says, 'Yacob, old poy, let's have some red-eye! and
mind you, Yacob, pring an extra glass for yourself.' Vell
den, I prings der pottle of ret-eye, and da drinks two dree
dimes, and I drinks mit 'em two dree dimes; and I gets so
tam trunk dat I lies down on der pench and goes to shleep.
Ven I vakes up, der room ish dark as der tyfel, put I hears
der young chaps calling der gards; von says, 'bass!' nodder
says, 'left power!&mdash;right power!' den nodder von, he says,
'uker'd!' and shwears like a drooper. Da vas all blaying
at der taple, shust as da vas ven I goes to shleep, but mine
eyes vas nix&mdash;I could shust see notting at all&mdash;the room
vas bitch dark. So I dinks I vas plind, and I feel pad, and
I cry out, 'Oh, mine Gott! I p'lieve I'm shtruck plind!'
Den der young chaps leaves der taple and gomes vhere I vas,
and makes p'leeve da very sorry. One says, 'Poor Yacob!
you can no see&mdash;vat vill der poor man's vamerly do!' Nodder
call me poor cuss, and says I no pusiness to trink noding
stronger dan lager. I got mat den&mdash;mat as dunder&mdash;and
I says to him, 'Vy, den, you vants me to drink it mit you?
I p'leeve you put shtuff in der liquor to make me plind!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Den he laughs at me, and says I needn't trink if I didn't pe
a mind to. Shust den von little poy gomes to der door mit
a lantern, and I finds der drick da vas blaying me&mdash;I
see shust as goot as ever! Der rascals had plow out der
lights, and make p'leeve play uker to vool me! I told 'em
'twas all humpug, and they petter glear out, for I vouldn't
light up no more. Dat's vat mine shaloon vas shut up for."</p>

<h2>THE DUTCHMAN WHO GAVE MRS.
SCUDDER THE SMALL-POX.</h2>


<p>Some years ago, a droll sort of a Dutchman was the driver
of a stage in New Jersey, and he passed daily through the
small hamlet of Jericho. One morning, just as the vehicle
was starting from Squash Point, a person came up and requested
the driver to take in a small box, and "leave it at
Mrs. Scudder's, third house on the left after you get into
Jericho."</p>

<p>"Yaas, oh yaas, Mr. Ellis, I knows der haus!" said the
driver," I pleeve der voman dakes in vashin', vor I always
sees her mit her clothes hung out."</p>

<p>"You're right, that's the place," said Ellis (for that was
the man's name), "she washes for one of the steamboats."</p>

<p>The box was thereupon duly deposited in the front boot,
the driver took his 'leven-penny bit for carrying it, and the
stage started on its winding way. In an hour or two, the
four or five houses comprising the village of Jericho hove in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
sight. In front of one of them, near the door, a tall, muscular
woman was engaged at a wash-tub; while lines of white
linen, fluttering in the wind, ornamented the adjoining lawn.
The stage stopped at the gate, when the following ludicrous
dialogue, and attendant circumstances, took place:&mdash;</p>

<p>Driver&mdash;Is dis Miss Scutter's haus?</p>

<p>Woman [looking up, without stopping her work,]&mdash;Yes,
I'm Mrs. Scudder.</p>

<p>Driver&mdash;I'fe got der small pox in der stage; vill you
come out and dake it?</p>

<p>Woman [suddenly throwing down the garment she was
washing]&mdash;Got the small-pox! Mercy on me! why do you
stop here, you wicked man? You'd better be off, quick as
you can. [Runs into the house.]</p>

<p>Driver mutters to himself&mdash;I vonder vat's der matter mit
der fool; I'fe goot mind to drow it over der fence.</p>

<p>Upon second thought, he takes the box, gets off the stage,
and carries it into the house. But in an instant he reappears,
followed by a broom with an enraged woman at the
end of it, who is shouting in a loud voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"You git out of this! clear yourself quicker! You've no
business to come here exposing decent people to the small-pox;
what do you mean by it?"</p>

<p>"I dells you it's der shmall <em>pox</em>!" exclaimed the Dutchman,
emphasising the word box as plainly as he could&mdash;"Ton't
you versteh?&mdash;der shmall <em>pox</em> dat Misther Ellis
sends to you."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Scudder was too much excited to comprehend
this explanation, even if she had listened to it. Having it
fixed in her mind that there was a case of small-pox on the
stage, and that the driver was asking her to take into the
house a passenger thus afflicted, her indignation knew no
bounds. "Clear out!" exclaimed she, excitedly, "I'll call
the men folks if you don't clear!" and then shouting at the
top of her voice, "Ike! you Ike! where are you?" Ike
soon made his appearance, and inquired&mdash;</p>

<p>"W-what's the matter, mother?"</p>

<p>The driver answered&mdash;"I dells you now onct more, for
der last time, I'fe got der shmall pox; and Misther Ellis he
dells me to gif it to Miss Scutter, and if dat vrow ish Miss
Scutter, vy she no dake der pox?"</p>

<p>By this time several of the passengers had got off the stage
to see the fun, and one of them explained to Mrs. Scudder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
that it was a box, and not small-pox, that the driver wished
to leave with her.</p>

<p>The woman had become so thoroughly frightened that
she was still incredulous, until a bright idea struck Ike.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!" exclaimed he," I know what 'tis&mdash;it's
Madame Ellis's box of laces, sent to be done up."</p>

<p>With this explanation the affair was soon settled, and
Mistress Scudder received the Dutchman's "shmall pox"
amidst the laughter and shouts of the occupants of the old
stage-coach. The driver joined in, although he had not the
least idea of what they were laughing at, and as the vehicle
rolled away, he added not a little to the mirth by saying, in
a triumphant tone of voice, "I vas pound ter gif der old
vomans der shmall pox, vether she vould dake it or not!"</p>

<h2>A DUTCH SERMON.</h2>


<p>Mine friends, ven first you come here, you was poor; and
now, friends, you is prout; and you's gotten on your unicorns,
ant dem vits you like a dongs upon a hog's pack. Now,
mine friends, let me dell you dis: a man is a man if he's no
pigger as my dumb. Ven Tavid vent out to fight mit Goliah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
he dook noting vid him but one sling. Now don't mistake
me, mine friends: it vas not a rum sling; no, nor a gin sling;
no, nor a mint vater sling; no: it was a sling made mit an
hickory stick. Now, ven Goliah sees Tavid coming, "You
little dampt scoundrel, does you comes to vight me? I vill
give you to de birds of de fielt, and de peasts of de air!"
Tavid says, "Goliah, Goliah, de race is not always mit de
shwift, nor ish de battle mit de strong; and a man is a
man if he's no pigger ash my dumb." So Tavid he fixes
a shtone in his sling, and he drows it at Goliah, and knocks
him rite in de vorehead; and den Tavid takes Goliah's
swort, and cuts off his head; and den all de pretty cals
comes out and strewed flowers in his way, and sung, "Saul
is a creat man, vor he has kilt his tousands; put Tavid is
creater as he, vor he has kilt Goliah." Now, mine friends,
when you coes out to vight mit te rebels, remember vat I
dell you,&mdash;dat a man is a man if he's no pigger as my

<h2>A TUSSLE WITH IMMIGRANTS.</h2>


<p>The Ethnological Society of North America wished me to
photograph types of immigrants arriving from Europe, at
New York.</p>

<p>Castle Garden is where all steerage passengers land; and
I was allowed every facility by the authorities.</p>

<p>I began with an Italian, swarthy, under-sized, dressed in
velveteen, and scented with garlic. As I placed him in front
of the camera, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah been here before. Ah no greenhorn. Ah know
the ropes a. You take a pictura don't cost you a centa; you
don't pay me a dolla; ah make ah face a so you don't getta
the pictura. You don't picka me up a sardine. I sale the
banana lass year in New York."</p>

<p>A Frenchman was the next subject. Tall, meagre, polite,
and talkative.</p>

<p>"Sare," he remarked, "ze photographie ees not to me for
ze first taime. Ze art of all kind faind himself at home in
ma countrie&mdash;<i lang="fr">la belle France</i>. I also am artist. I make ze
wall papaire to beautify ze house. I am artist in ze pastepot,
and ze scissaires. To faind already a brothaire artist
makes me to weep. Excuse me zat I weep. I remove to
you ze hat; I salute ze veritable artist." Then this artist
tried to kiss me, and because I repulsed him stood in gloomy
majesty while I photographed him.</p>

<p>Following my French friend, a Scotchman was brought.
He wished me to take pictures of his entire family&mdash;eleven
in all&mdash;and when informed that only types, not families,
were required, he broke forth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm no able exactly to see why types should be needed,
and no families. A type is guid eneugh thing gin ye'll
want to prent a paper, but a lairge family o' braw lads an'
bonnie lasses gangs a lang distance in a new land, an' I'm
free to say my ain family is the lairgest ye'll see frae the
ship."</p>

<p>Even the stolid immigrants had to smile when the next
subject was brought. He was a young German, tight-sleeved,
long-skirted, smiling, and chatty.</p>

<p>"Vell! Py jimmeny! you took my picture mid a box!
How you done it I gifs oop! Und you told me ov I move I
spoil him alretty. Den I don'd move. Ov a flea pites me,
I don'd move,&mdash;ov you don'd stand me too long. Ov a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
gifs me a glass of peer, I don'd move. Ov I got hungry, I
don'd go to dinner all der vile. I shoost stand here like
I vas a dellygraff bole! Don'd it?"</p>

<p>I finished the morning's work with a splendid specimen
of a young Irishman, who had, I suspect, been injudiciously
"treated" by his friends.</p>

<p>As I placed him before the camera, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Av' it's taking aim ye are, don't say I thrimbled. God
knows I'm willin' an' proud to die for ould Oireland!
Foire! ye base murdherer, to desthroy me the day I kem
ashore!"</p>

<p>Matters were explained, and he apologized.</p>

<p>"Why didn't ye say ye wouldn't shoot? How would I
know ye didn't have dynamite in yer box? Av its only
the picthure av me mug you want, take it an' welkim.
I'm no pig to be wantin' to kape a threasure hid from the
wurruld."</p>

<p>In departing I explained to the group that I would present
each one with a copy of his picture if their addresses were
furnished, and a Babel of words followed me.</p>

<p>"Ah don't want a picture a. Ah want a dolla!"</p>

<p>"Sare, I am <i lang="fr">comble de l'honneur</i>. I zank you, sare!"</p>

<p>"I'm vara muckle ableeged till ye. I'll tak' a dozen on
the same tairms."</p>

<p>"Ov I don'd send you dot address, never mind; you send
me dot bicture, ennyhow!"</p>

<p>"Faith! Amerika's a darlin' counthry! The best word I
got at home was, Leve the way, ye vagabone! Here it is,
Misther O'Ryan, will it plaze ye have yer picther taken, an'
where'll we send it for ye?"</p>

feeling dot I shust so pig as Carl Schurz, I goes after der

Shteward, vedder or not she owns all dot nice buildings.
Anoder leetle poy opens dot door so nicely, unt he looks me
in der face so shmilings dot I tinks praps it vos Dolly's
brudder; und mine heart he goes so hot like fire; most like
der pig, plazing Shecawgo fire. Und I says to der poy, so
shweet I could, you know, "You hav der sister here, aint

dot het go so, like dot. I shpeaks no more mit der poy, but
I goes to der shtand, vare I sees von fine gentleman, und I
says, "I vould dot young lady see, vot der leetle poy givs me
paper von."&mdash;"Vot is dot?" says der shentlemans. Denn I
says, "I vants mine Dolly Varden!" Und der man says,
"Dolly Varden! come dis vay ven you blease." Und I
follows dot man mit mine heart full von great tremblings
unt joy put togedder, shust like der apple und meat in der
mince-pie. Put vat is dot he do now? He go und show me
a leetle piece von cloth, mit great many putiful color. Denn
I say, "You nixverstay me. I no vant to see her dress. I
vould see Dolly Varden she self." Dere goes more vunder
donn der poy hat over der face von der shentlemans, und he
say, "Dis is Dolly Varden." Denn I say, "Dolly Varden!
Dolly Varden! Oh! I no vant such voomans as dot." Und
mine mind runs vay mit mine het, unt mine het runs vay
mit mine bodies, und mine bodies runs vay mit mine feet,
und der shtore is vay on der odder side von me. Und ven I

<p>Und denn ven I tinks on vot I pees und vat I used to vas,

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A Frenchman once&mdash;so runs a certain ditty&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had crossed the Straits to famous London city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To get a living by the arts of France,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And teach his neighbor, rough John Bull, to dance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, lacking pupils, vain was all his skill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fortunes sank from low to lower still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until at last,&mdash;pathetic to relate,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor monsieur landed at starvation's gate.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Standing one day beside a cook-shop door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gazing in, with aggravation sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He mused within himself what he should do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fill his empty maw, and pocket too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By nature shrewd, he soon contrived a plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus to execute it straight began.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A piece of common brick he quickly found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a harder stone to powder ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then wrapped the dust in many a dainty piece<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of paper, labelled "Poison for de Fleas,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sallied forth, his roguish trick to try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To show his treasures, and to see who'd buy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From street to street he cried with lusty yell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Here's grand and sovereign <em>flea-poudare</em> to sell!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fickle Fortune seemed to smile at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For soon a woman hailed him as he passed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck a quick bargain with him for the lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made him five crowns richer on the spot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our wight, encouraged by this ready sale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went into business on a larger scale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon, throughout all London, scattered he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The "only genuine poudare for de flea."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Engaged one morning in his new vocation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mingled boasting and dissimulation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought he heard himself in anger called;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sure enough, the self-same woman bawled&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In not a mild or very tender mood&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the same window where before she stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hey, there," said she, "you Monsher Powder-man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Escape my clutches now, sir, if you can.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll let you dirty, thieving Frenchmen know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That decent people won't be cheated so."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then spoke monsieur, and heaved a saintly sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With humble attitude and tearful eye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, madame! s'il vous plait, attendez vous,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Frenchmen jumped at such an offer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monsieur did not forget his proffer;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But at the first hotel on shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They stopped to lodge and board.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Frenchman ordered in his way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dinner to be done that day;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But here occurred a grievous bore:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monsieur of English knew but little.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tapps of French knew not a tittle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ordering dinner, therefore, 'tis no wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they should make a blunder.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether the landlord knew, or no,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sequel of my tale will show.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He blundered, and it cannot be denied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some small disadvantage on his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The order seemed immense to Boniface:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But more the expense, to him the greater fun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all that from the order he could trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Was,&mdash;"Messieur Bull, you lettee me have, I say,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Vich for vid cash, I sal you pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i6"><em>Fifteen of those vid vich the sheep do run</em>!"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From which old Tapps could only understand<br /></span>
<span class="i6">(But whether right or wrong, cared not a button),<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That what monsieur desired, with air so grand,<br /></span>
<span class="i6"><em>Was fifteen legs of mutton</em>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A dinner most enormous!" cried the elf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Zounds! each must eat a leg, near, to himself!"<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
<span class="i0">However, they seemed a set of hungry curs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, without more bother or demurs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tapps to his cook his orders soon expressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fifteen legs of mutton quick were dressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now around the table all elate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Frenchman's friends the dinner doth await.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joy sparkled in each hungry urchin's eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they beheld, with glad surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tapps quick appear with leg of mutton hot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smoking, and just ejected from the pot!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughed, stared, and chuckled more and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When <em>two</em> they saw, then <em>three</em>, then <em>four</em>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a <em>fifth</em> their eager glances blessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a <em>sixth</em>, larger than all the rest!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But soon the Frenchman's countenance did change,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To see the legs of mutton on the table.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Surprise and rage by turns<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In his face burns,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While Tapps the table did arrange<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As nice as he was able.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And while the Frenchmen for the feast prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thus, in a voice that quite the landlord scared,<br /></span>
<span class="i18">Our hero said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Mon Dieu, monsieur! vy for you make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dis vera great blundare and mistake?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vy for you bring to me dese mouton legs?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tapps with a bow his pardon begs:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I've done as you have ordered, sir," said he.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Did you not order <em>fifteen legs</em> of me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Six</em> of which before your eyes appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <em>nine besides</em> are nearly done down-stair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, John!"&mdash;"Go, hang you, Jean! you fool! you ass!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You one great clown to bring me to dis pass:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take vay dis meat, for vich I sall no pay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did no order dat."&mdash;"What's that you say?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tapps answered with a frown and with a stare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You ordered fifteen legs of me, I'll swear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or <em>fifteen things with which the sheep do run</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which <em>means the same</em>:&mdash;I'm not so easy done."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Parbleu, monsieur! vy you no comprehend?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You may take back de legs unto de pot:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I telle you, sare, 'tis not de legs I vant,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Why, hang it!" cried the landlord in a rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which monsieur vainly tried to assuage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hang it!" said he, as to the door he totters:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Now, after all the trouble that I took,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These legs of mutton both to buy and cook,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">It seems instead of <em>fifteen legs,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>You merely wanted fifteen poor sheep's trotters</em>!"<br /></span>

<h2>I VANT TO FLY.</h2>

<p class="center">A HUMOROUS RECITATION.&mdash;FRENCH DIALECT.</p>


<p>Shortly before the conclusion of the war with Napoleon,
there were a number of French officers in an inland town
on their parole of honor. Now, one gentleman being tired
with the usual routine of eating, drinking, gambling, smoking,
etc., therefore, in order to amuse himself otherwise, resolved
to go a-fishing. His host supplied him with rod and
line, but, being in want of artificial flies, he went in search
of a fishing-tackle maker's shop. Having found one, kept
by a plain, painstaking John Bull, our Frenchman entered,
and with a bow, a cringe, and a shrug of the shoulders,
thus began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, Monsieur Anglais! comment vous portez-vous?"</p>

<p>"Eh! that's French," exclaimed the shopkeeper; "not
that I understand it, but I'm very well, if that's what you
mean."</p>

<p>"Bon, bon, ver good; den, sare, I sall tell you, I vant
deux fly."</p>

<p>"I dare say you do, mounseer," replied the Englishman,
"and so do a great many more of your outlandish gentry;
but I'm a true-born Briton, and can never consent to assist
the enemies of my country to leave it, particularly when
they cost us so much to bring them here."</p>

<p>"Ah, monsieur, you no comprehend! I shall repeate, I
vant deux fly, on the top of de vater."</p>

<p>"Oh! what, you want to fly by water, do you? then I'm
sure I can't assist you; for we are at least a hundred miles
from the seacoast, and our canal is not navigable above
ten or twelve miles from here."</p>

<p>"Diable! sare, you are un stup of the block. I sall tell
you once seven times over again&mdash;I vant deux fly on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
top of de vater, to dingle dangle at the end of de long
pole."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay! you only fly, mounseer, by land or water, and
if they catch you, I'll be hanged if they won't dingle dangle
you, as you call it, at the end of a long pole."</p>

<p>"Sacre un de Dieu! la blas! vat you mean by dat, enfer
diable? you are un bandit jack of de ass, Johnny de Bull.
Ba, ba, you are effrontee, and I disgrace me to parley vid
you! I tell you, sare, dat I vant deux fly on the top of de
vater, to dingle dangle at the end of the long pole, to la
trap poisson."</p>

<p>"What's that you say, you French mounseer&mdash;you'll lay
a trap to poison me and all my family, because I won't assist
you to escape? why, the like was never heard. Here,
Betty, go for the constable."</p>

<p>The constable soon arrived, who happened to be as ignorant
as the shopkeeper; and of course, it was not expected
that a constable should be a scholar. Thus the man of
office began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's all this? Betty has been telling me that this
here outlandish Frenchman is going to poison you and all
your family! Ay, ay, I should like to catch him at it,
that's all! Come, come to prison, you delinquent."</p>

<p>"No, sare, I sall not go to de prison; take me before de
what you call it&mdash;de ting that nibble de grass?"</p>

<p>"Nibble grass? You mean sheep?"</p>

<p>"No, I mean de&mdash;de"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean the cow!"</p>

<p>"No, sare, not de cow; you stup Johnny bœuf&mdash;I mean
de cheval, vat you ride. [Imitating.] Come, sare, gee up.
Ah, ha!"</p>

<p>"Oh, now I know! you mean a horse."</p>

<p>"No, sare, I mean de horse's vife."</p>

<p>"What, the mare?"</p>

<p>"Oui, bon, yes, sare; take me to de mayor."</p>

<p>This request was complied with; and the French officer
soon stood before the English magistrate, who, by chance,
happened to be better informed than his neighbors, and
thus explained the dilemma of the unfortunate Frenchman,
to the satisfaction of all parties:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have mistaken the intention of this honest gentleman:
he did not want to fly the country, but to go a-fishing,
and for that purpose went to your shop to purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
two flies, by way of bait, or, as he expressed it, to la trap
la poisson. Poisson, in French, is fish."</p>

<p>"Why, ay," replied the shopkeeper, "that may be true,
you are a scholard, and so you know better than I. Poison:
in French, may be very good fish, but give me good old
English roast beef."</p>

<h2>THE FRENCHMAN'S MISTAKE.</h2>

<p class="center">FRENCH DIALECT RECITATION.</p>


<p>Not long since, a sober, middle-aged gentleman was
quietly dozing in one of our railroad-trains, when his pleasant,
drowsy meditations were suddenly interrupted by the
sharp voice of the individual by his side. This was no
less a personage than a dandified, hot-blooded, inquisitive
Frenchman, who raised his hairy visage close to that of the
gentleman he addressed.</p>

<p>"Pardonnez, sare; but vat you do viz ze pictair&mdash;<em>hein</em>?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, monsieur pointed to some beautiful steel-plate
engravings in frames, which the quiet gentleman held
in his lap, and which suited the fancy of the little French
connoisseur precisely.</p>

<p>The quiet gentleman looked at the inquisitive foreigner
with a scowl which he meant to be very forbidding, and
made no reply. The Frenchman, nothing daunted, once
more approached his hairy visage into that of his companion,
and repeated the question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vat you do viz ze pictair&mdash;<em>hein</em>?"</p>

<p>"I am taking them to Salem," replied the quiet gentleman
gruffly.</p>

<p>"Ha! you take 'em to sell 'em!" chimed in the shrill
voice of the Frenchman. "I be glad of zat, by gar! I like
ze pictair. I buy 'em of you, sare. Mow much you ask?"</p>

<p>"They are not for sale," replied the sleepy gentleman,
more thoroughly awake, by the by, and not a little irritated.</p>

<p>"<em>Hein</em>?" grunted monsieur in astonishment. "Vat you
say, sare?"</p>

<p>"I say I don't want to sell the pictures!" cried the other,
at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>"By gar! <i lang="fr">c'est drole</i>!" exclaimed the Frenchman, his eye
beginning to flash with passion. "It is one strange circumstance,
<em>parbleu</em>! I ask you vat you do viz ze pictair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and you say you take 'em to sell 'em, and zen you vill not
sell 'em! Vat you mean, sare&mdash;<em>hein</em>?"</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," replied the other sharply. "I
don't want to sell the engravings, and I didn't say I did."</p>

<p>"<em>Morbleu!</em>" sputtered monsieur, in a tone loud enough
to attract the attention of those of his fellow-travellers who
were not already listening; "<em>morbleu</em>! you mean to say I
'ave not any ear? <em>Non</em>, monsieur, by gar I hear ver' well
vat you tell me. You say you sell ze pictair. Is it because
I one Frenchman, zat you will not sell me ze pictair?"</p>

<p>The irritated gentleman, hoping to rid himself of the
annoyance, turned his back upon his assailant, and made
no reply.</p>

<p>But monsieur was not to be put off thus. He laid his
hand on the shoulder of the other, and, showing his small
white teeth, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Sacristie!</em> monsieur, zis is too muche. You've give
me one insult, and I shall 'ave satisfaction." Still no reply.
"By gar, monsieur," continued the Frenchman, "you are
not one gentleman. I shall call you one <em>poltroon</em>&mdash;vat you
call 'em?&mdash;coward!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" retorted the other, afraid the
affair was beginning to get serious. "I haven't insulted
you, sir."</p>

<p>"Pardonnez, monsieur; but it is one grand insult! In
America, perhaps not; but in France, one blow your brains
out."</p>

<p>"For what, pray?"</p>

<p>"For vat? <em>Parbleu!</em> you call me one <em>menteur</em>&mdash;how
you speak 'em&mdash;liar? you call me one liar? you call me
one liar?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir! You misunderstood"&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, by gar! I've got ears. You say you vill sell ze
pictair; and ven I tell you vat you say, you say ze contrarie&mdash;zat
is not so!"</p>

<p>"But I didn't tell you I would sell the pictures," remonstrated
the man with the engravings, beginning to feel
alarmed at the passion manifested by the other. "You
misunderstood"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I tell you no! It is not posseebl'! Ven I ask you vat
you do viz ze pictair, vat you say?"</p>

<p>"I said I was taking them to Salem."</p>

<p>"Yes, <em>parbleu</em>!" exclaimed monsieur, more angry than
ever: "you say you take 'em to sell 'em"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no!" interrupted the other, "not to <em>sell them</em>, but
<em>Salem</em>&mdash;the city of Salem."</p>

<p>"Ze city of Sell 'em!" exclaimed the Frenchman, amid
the roars of laughter that greeted his ears. "<em>Sacristie!</em>
Zat is one grand mistake. Pardon, monsieur! <i lang="fr">Que je suis
bête!</i> Ze city of Sell 'em? Ha, ha! I vill remember
zat, by gar!" And he stroked his mustache with his
fingers, while the man with the engravings once more gave
way to his drowsy inclinations.</p>

<h2>"TWO TOLLAR?"</h2>

<p class="center">[From the Detroit Free Press.]</p>

<p>There was a slight blaze on the roof of a house on Russell
Street a few days ago; and when the insurance adjusters
went up to make their survey, they found that about two
dollars would cover all the loss.</p>

<p>"Two tollar!" exclaimed the owner when he heard the
decision&mdash;"I can't take no two tollar."</p>

<p>"But you see for yourself that a dozen shingles and an
hour's work will make good all damages."</p>

<h2>A FRENCHMAN ON MACBETH.</h2>


<p>An enthusiastic French student of Shakspeare thus comments
on the tragedy of Macbeth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! your Mossieu' Shak-es-pier! He is gr-r-aand&mdash;mysterieuse&mdash;sooblime!

<h2>WARNING TO WOMAN.</h2>


<p>"John," said Mrs. Sanscript to her husband one evening
last week, "I've been reading the paper."&mdash;"That's nothin',"
grunted John: "I've seen people before who read newspapers."&mdash;"Yes;
but there are several things in the paper
I can't understand."&mdash;"Then don't read 'em."&mdash;"What do
they mean by the strike, John? What is a strike, anyhow?"&mdash;"A
strike is where they have struck;" and Sanscript
knocked the ashes from his cigar. "I don't grasp your meaning
exactly," said Mrs. Sanscript, with a puzzled look.
"Now, these strikers have stopped all the railroad-trains in
the country. Why did they do it?"&mdash;"To prevent 'em from
running."&mdash;"Yes, but why didn't they want trains to run?"&mdash;"Because
they wanted more money for running them."&mdash;"Do
they pay more for stopping trains than for running
them?"&mdash;"No, you stupid woman!"&mdash;"Then why in the
world did they stop 'em? why didn't they run more of 'em, or
run 'em faster? Seems to me that would pay better."&mdash;"Mary
Ann, you will never surround the problem."&mdash;"Maybe
not, John. Some things are gotten up purposely to
bother women. Now here is a column headed 'Base-Ball.'
What is base-ball, John?"&mdash;"Don't you know what base-ball
is? Happy woman! you have not lived in vain."&mdash;"Here
it says that 'The Hartfords could not collar Cumming's
curves.' What under the sun are Cumming's
curves?"&mdash;"It's the way he delivers the ball."&mdash;"Is the
ball chained?"&mdash;"No, you booby!"&mdash;"Then how does he
deliver it?"&mdash;"I mean, pitches it."&mdash;"Oh! Now here it
says Jones muffed a ball after a hard run. What was a ball
doing after a hard run?"&mdash;"Hadn't you better confine your
research to the obituary and marriage columns, Mary, with
an occasional advertisement thrown in to vary the monotony?"&mdash;"Yes,
but, John, I want to know! There's Mrs.
Racket, over the way, who goes to all the base-ball games,
and comes home to talk me blind about 'fly fouls,' 'base
hits,' 'sky-scrapers,' and all those things. For heaven's
sake, John, what is a sky-scraper?"&mdash;"Compose yourself,
old woman. You are treading on dangerous ground; your
feet are on slippery rocks, while raging billows roll beneath."&mdash;"Mercy
on me! What do you mean?"&mdash;"I mean, my
dear madam, that whenever a woman begins to pry about
among three strikes, fair balls, base hits, daisy cutters, home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
runs, and kindred subjects, she's in danger of being lost."&mdash;"Well,
I confess I'm completely lost to know what this
newspaper means when it says Addy stole a base, while
the spectators applauded. Have we come to such a pass
that society will applaud a theft? Why wasn't Addy arrested?
Now here's Manning put out by Start, assisted by
Carey, and I can't see that he did any thing wrong, either.
Jemima Christopher! Here it says that Pike flew out. I
don't believe a word of it. I never saw a man fly yet, and
I won't believe it can be done till I see it with my own eyes.
John, what makes these newspaper men lie so horribly?"</p>

<p>John was asleep; and Mrs. Sanscript turned gloomily, not
to say sceptically, to the letter-list for information. Newspapers
were not made for women.</p>

<h2>AN EXCITING CONTEST.</h2>


<p>We have doubts about the following story, which comes
to us from the interior; but the author is responsible for
what he says, and his name can be obtained upon application
at this office.</p>

<p>Last winter two of my neighbors, Mr. Miller and Mr.
Grant, lost their wives upon the same day; and both of the
funerals took place three days afterwards, the interments
being made at the cemetery about the same hour. As the
two funeral parties were coming out of the burying-ground,
Miller met Grant; and, clasping each other's hand, they indulged
in a sympathetic squeeze, and the following conversation
ensued:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Miller.</em> "I'm sorry for you. It's an unspeakable loss,
isn't it?"</p>

<p><em>Grant.</em> "Awful! She was the best woman that ever
lived."</p>

<p><em>Miller.</em> "She was, indeed. I never met her equal. She
was a good wife to me."</p>

<p><em>Grant.</em> "I was referring to my wife. There couldn't be
two best, you know."</p>

<p><em>Miller.</em> "Yes, I know. I know well enough that your wife
couldn't hold a candle to mine."</p>

<p><em>Grant.</em> "She couldn't, hey? Couldn't hold a candle!
Why, she could dance all round Mrs. Miller every day in the
week, including Sundays, and not half try! She was an
unmitigated angel, take her any way you would."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Miller.</em> "Oh! she was, was she? Well, I don't want to
be personal; but if I owned a cross-eyed angel with red hair
and no teeth, and as bony as an omnibus-horse, I'd kill her
if she didn't die of her own accord. Dance!&mdash;how could a
woman dance that had feet like candle-boxes, and lame at
that?"</p>

<p><em>Grant.</em> "Better be cross-eyed than wear the kind of a
red nose that your wife flourished around this community.
I bet it'll burn a hole through the coffin-lid. And you pretend
you're sorry she's gone. But you can't impose on me:
I know you're so glad you can hardly hold in. She was the
chuckle-headedest woman that ever disgraced a graveyard:
that's what <em>she</em> was."</p>

<p><em>Miller.</em> "If you abuse my wife, I'll knock you down."</p>

<p><em>Grant.</em> "I'd like to see you try it."</p>

<p>Then the two disconsolate widowers engaged in a hand-to-hand
combat; and, after tussling a while in the snow, the
mourners pulled them apart, just as Mr. Miller was about
to insist upon his wife's virtues by biting off Mr. Grant's
nose.</p>

<p>When they got home, Mr. Grant tied crape upon all his
window-shutters to show how deeply he mourned; and, as
Miller knew that his grief for Mrs. Miller was deeper, he
not only decorated his shutters, but he fixed five yards of
black bombazine on the bell-pull, and dressed his whole
family in mourning. Then Grant determined that his duty
to the departed was not to let himself be beaten by a man
who couldn't feel any genuine sorrow: so he sewed a black
flag on his lightning-rod, and festooned the front of his
house with black alpaca.</p>

<p>Then Miller became excited; and he expressed his sense
of bereavement by painting his dwelling black, and by putting
up a monument to Mrs. Miller in his front-yard. Grant
thereupon stained his yellow horse with lampblack, tied
crape to his cow's horn, daubed his dog with ink, and began
to wipe his nose on a black handkerchief. As soon as Miller
saw these proceedings, he spread a layer of charcoal all over
his front-yard, he assumed a black shirt, he corked the faces
of his family when they went to church, and he hired a
colored man to stand on his steps and cry for twelve hours
every day. Just as Grant was about to see this, and go it
one better, he encountered Miss Lang, a young lady from the
city; and in a couple of weeks they were engaged. Then
he began to take in the evidences of his grief; and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
made Miller so mad, that he went around and proposed to
Miss Jones, an old maid who never had an offer before.
She accepted him on the spot; and they were married the
day before Grant's wedding, which so disgusted him that he
would have given up Lang if she hadn't threatened him
with a suit for breach of promise. There is peace between
the two families now; but, when Mrs. Miller gets on the
rampage sometimes, Mr. Miller mourns for his first wife
more than ever.</p>

<h2>A LAUGHING PHILOSOPHER.</h2>


<p>Admiring my flowers, sir? P'raps you'd step inside the
gate, and walk round my little place? It ain't big, but
there's plenty of variety,&mdash;violets and cabbages, roses and
artichokes. Any one that didn't care for flowers 'ud be sure
to find beauty in them young spring onions. People's ideas
differ very much, there ain't a doubt of it. One man's very
happy over a glass of whiskey and water, and another thinks
every thing 'ud go straight in this 'ere world if we all drank
tea and lemonade. And it's right enough: it keeps things
even. We should have the world a very one-sided affair if
everybody pulled the same way. Philosopher, am I? Well,
I dunno. I've got a theory to be sure&mdash;every one has nowadays;
and mine is, that there is a joke to be found in every
mortal thing if only we look in the right place for it. But
some people don't know how to look for it. Why, sir, if
you'll believe it, I was talking to a man yesterday that
couldn't see any thing to laugh at in the naval demonstration.</p>

<p>Am I independent? Well, I makes money by my fruit
and vegetables, if that's what you mean. But there's so
many ways of being independent. One man marries a
woman with £20,000 a year, and calls that independence.
Another votes on the strongest side, and calls that being independent.
One takes up every new-fangled idea that
comes out, and says he's independent. Some calls impudence
independence. There's not a name as fits so many
different articles. No! I've never bin married. Somehow, I
don't think married men see the fun in every thing same as
single ones. I don't mean to be disrespectful to the ladies,
but I do think they enjoy a good cry more than a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
laugh. Was I ever in love? and did I laugh then? Why,
yes, never laughed heartier in my life. It's a good many
years ago now. I was living in lodgings down Clerkenwell
way, and the landlady's daughter was as pretty a creature as
ever you see, bright and cheery, like a robin, when first I
knew her. But, by and by, she grew pale and peaky,&mdash;used
to go about the house without singing, and had such big,
sad-looking eyes. Her home wasn't a particularly happy
one, for her mother was a nagger. Perhaps you've never
come across a woman of that pertikler character. Well,
then, you should say double the prayers of ordinary people;
for you've much to be thankful for. I never looked at her
without feeling that her husband must have been very
happy indeed when he got to heaven. I sometimes think,
sir, that women of this sort might be made use of, and
prisons, and all other kind of punishment, done away with:
perhaps, though, the lunatic asylums 'ud get too full.</p>

<p>Well, I grew to be quite intimate with Bessie; and one
evening, I don't know how it was, she told me all her troubles.
She was engaged to a young man; and her mother
wouldn't consent to them marrying, and was always worrying
her to break it off. I asked her if there were any thing
against him. Nothing, except that her mother had taken a
dislike to him: he wasn't very strong, but he was the best,
cleverest, dearest fellow that ever lived. All the time she
was talking I felt a gnawing sort of pain somewhere in my
inside. First, I thought I must be hungry; but, when I came
to eat, all my food seemed to get in my throat, and stick
there. This won't do, old fellow, thinks I: there must be
a joke to be got out of it somewhere. So I set to consider;
and there, clear enough, it was. Why, the joke 'ud be to let
Bessie marry her young man, and see the pretty cheeks grow
round and pink again. But how to do it, there was the rub.
I began to cultivate the old lady's society with a view to
finding out her weak point: for, being a woman, of course
she had a weak point; and, being a very ugly woman, what
do you think it was? Why, vanity, to be sure. I soon noticed
a change in her. She took her hair out of paper every
day, instead of only on Sundays, as she had been used to do;
and she put on a clean cap sometimes, and smirked whenever
I passed her. Why, here's a bigger joke than I bargained
for, thinks I! While I've been studying the woman to find
out her weak point, she thinks I've been admiring her. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
I soon saw what use I could make of this. I went down
into the kitchen when she wasn't busy,&mdash;I knew it would be
rather too hot other times,&mdash;and I got talking about Bessie.
"It's strange," I says, "that a fine-looking girl like that
shouldn't have a sweetheart. Things was different when
you was younger, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>"As for that," says she, "Bessie has a sweetheart; but
I don't approve of him. He's not exactly the sort of man I
expected for her."</p>

<p>"But, lor'," I says, "you wouldn't go and keep that girl
single! Think what harm you may do yourself. You can't
be so cruel as to give up all idea of marrying agin! Why,
you don't look forty." That wasn't an untruth, for she
looked fifty. She tossed her head, and told me to go along.
I didn't go along. I says, "There's no doubt lots of young
fellows 'ud be glad enough of a good-looking wife like you,
but mightn't care for a daughter as old as Miss Bessie."
This seemed to strike her very much. I followed it up, got
talking to her day after day, and always led the conversation
to the same point. At last one day when I came home
from work, she says, "It's all settled. Bessie's going to be
married, and her Tom's coming here this evening." Then I
went up to my own room, and laughed till I cried. Presently
I heard the little girl run up-stairs as she hadn't run
for many a long day, and I knew she'd gone to put on a
smart ribbon for Tom's sake. She tapped at my door as
she passed. Would I come down? somebody was there,
and wanted to know me. I called out that I was busy, and
couldn't come; and she went away. But after about an hour
she came again. I was sitting in the dark, thinking of a
good many things; and before I had time to speak she was
down oh her knees beside me, and hiding her face.</p>

<p>"You told me you were busy," she said; "and here you
are all in the dark and cold, and I can't bear any one to be
dull or lonely to-night, because I'm so very, very happy.
And I know it's all through you. Mother would never have
given in of her own accord. You've always been my friend
when I wanted one very badly; and now you must be angry
with me, or you wouldn't stay away to-night. And you
won't even speak to me. Oh, whatever I've done to vex
you, don't think of it any more!"</p>

<p>She nestled up to me so close that her hair touched my
coat-sleeve, and her pretty eyes looked up all swimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
with tears. I ground my teeth, and clinched my hands, or&mdash;or
I don't know what I mightn't ha' done. You see the joke
of this, sir, don't you? Here was the girl crying, and asking
me to forgive her, and like her a little; and there was I&mdash;not
disliking her a bit all the time. Ha, ha, ha! I had a hearty
laugh at her, and hurried with her down-stairs, and was introduced
to Tom, and I talked to the old lady, and drank the
young people's health, and was as happy as possible. And
on the wedding-day I gave her away as if I had been her
father; and I sang a song and danced: and, when the time
came for Bessie to go away with her husband, I dried her
eyes; for at the last moment the tender-hearted little thing
broke down, and cried, and kissed us all, and asked her
mother not to feel angry with her for leaving her all alone;
and then the mother cried, and what with having so many
eyes to wipe, I found myself wiping my own just as if it all
weren't a tremendous joke.</p>

<p>How have they got on since? 'Bout as well as most people,
I suppose: she loves him, and takes care of him. And
the mother's softened down a bit since she's bin a grandmother.
And as to my godson, there never was such a boy.
I have him with me as much as possible, and he's beginning
to see the joke of every thing almost as much as I do myself.
And when I die, all this little place'll belong to him, and
he'll be a rich man: so my death'll be the biggest joke of all,
you see, sir.</p>

<h2>SPOOPENDYKE OPENING OYSTERS.</h2>


<p>"My dear," queried Mr. Spoopendyke, "did you put those
oysters on the cellar floor with the round shells down, as I
told you to?"</p>

<p>"I did most of 'em," replied Mrs. Spoopendyke. "Some
of 'em wouldn't stay that way. They turned right over."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Must have been extraordinary intelligent oysters,"
murmured Mr. Spoopendyke, eying her with suspicion.
"Didn't any of 'em stand up on end, and ask for the
morning paper, did they?"</p>

<p>"You know what I mean," fluttered Mrs. Spoopendyke.
"They tipped over sideways, and so I laid them on the flat
shell."</p>

<p>"That's right," grunted Mr. Spoopendyke. "You want
to give an oyster his own way, or you'll hurt his feelings.
Suppose you bring up some of those gifted oysters, and an
oyster-knife, and we'll eat 'em."</p>

<p>Mrs. Spoopendyke hurried away, and pattered back with
the feast duly set out on a tea-waiter, which she placed
before Mr. Spoopendyke with a flourish.</p>

<p>"Now," said she, drawing up her sewing-chair, and resting
her elbows on her knees, and her chin on her hands,
"when you get all you want, you may open me some."</p>

<p>Mr. Spoopendyke whirled the knife around his head, and
brought it down with a sharp crack. Then he clipped away
at the end a moment, and jabbed at what he supposed was
the opening. The knife slipped, and ploughed the bark off
his thumb.</p>

<p>"Won't come open, won't ye?" he shouted, fetching it
another lick, and jabbing away again. "Haven't completed
your census of who's out here working at ye, have
ye?" and he brought it another whack. "P'rhaps ye think
I haven't fully made up my mind to inquire within, don't
ye?" and he rammed the point of the knife at it, knocking
the skin off his knuckles.</p>

<p>"That isn't the way to open an oyster," suggested Mrs.
Spoopendyke.</p>

<p>"Look here," roared Mr. Spoopendyke, turning fiercely on
his wife. "Have you got any private understanding with
this oyster? Has the oyster confided in you the particular
way in which he wants to be opened?"</p>

<p>"No-o!" stammered Mrs. Spoopendyke. "Only I
thought"&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is no time for thought!" shouted Mr. Spoopendyke,
banging away at the edge of the shell. "This is the
moment for battle; and if I've happened to catch this oyster
during office hours, he's going to enter into relations with
the undersigned. Come out, will ye?" he yelled, as the
knife flew up his sleeve. "Maybe ye don't recognize the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
voice of Spoopendyke. Come out, ye measly coward, before
ye make an enemy of me for life!" and he belted away at
the shell with the handle of the knife, and spattered mud
like a dredging-machine.</p>

<p>"Let me get you a hammer to crack him with," recommended
Mrs. Spoopendyke, hovering over her husband in
great perturbation.</p>

<p>"Don't want any hammer," howled Mr. Spoopendyke,
slamming around with his knife. "S'pose I'm going to use
brute force on a measly fish that I could swallow alive if I
could only get him out of his house? Open your measly
premises!" raved Mr. Spoopendyke, stabbing at the oyster
vindictively, and slicing his shirt-sleeve clear to the elbow.
"Come forth, and enjoy the society of Spoopendyke!" And
the worthy gentleman foamed at the mouth, and he sunk
back in his chair, and contemplated his stubborn foe with
glaring eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what to do," exclaimed Mrs. Spoopendyke,
radiant with a profound idea. "Crack him in the door."</p>

<p>"That's the scheme," grinned Mr. Spoopendyke, with
horrible contortions of visage. "Fetch me the door. Set
that door right before me on a plate. This oyster is going
to stay here. If you think this oyster is going to enjoy any
change of climate until he strikes the tropics of Spoopendyke,
you don't know the domestic habits of shell-fish.
Loose your hold!" squealed Mr. Spoopendyke, returning to
the charge, and fetching the bivalve a prodigious whack.
"Come into the outer world, where all is gay and beautiful.
Come out, and let me introduce you to my wife." And Mr.
Spoopendyke laid the oyster on the arm of his chair, and
slugged him remorselessly.</p>

<p>"Wait," squealed Mrs. Spoopendyke: "here's one with his
mouth open," and she pointed cautiously at a gaping oyster,
who had evidently taken down the shutters to see what the
row was about.</p>

<p>"Don't care a measly nickel with a hole in it," protested
Mr. Spoopendyke, thoroughly impatient. "Here's one
that's going to open his mouth, or the resurrection will find
him still wrestling with the ostensible head of this family.
Ow!" and Mr. Spoopendyke, having rammed the knife into
the palm of his hand, slammed the oyster against the
chimney-piece, where it was shattered, and danced around
the room wriggling with wrath and agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind the oysters, dear," cried Mrs. Spoopendyke,
following him around, and trying to disengage his wounded
hand from his armpit.</p>

<p>"Who's minding 'em?" roared Mr. Spoopendyke, standing
on one leg, and bending up double. "I tell ye that
when I start to inflict discipline on a narrow-minded oyster
that won't either accept an invitation or send regrets, he's
going to mind me! Where's the oyster? Show me the
oyster! Arraign the oyster!"</p>

<p>"Upon my word, you've opened him," giggled Mrs. Spoopendyke,
picking up the smashed bivalve between the tips
of her thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>"Won't have him," sniffed Mr. Spoopendyke, eying the
broken shell, and firing his defeated enemy into the grate.
"If I can't go in the front-door of an oyster, I'm not going
down the scuttle. That all comes of laying 'em on the flat
shell," he continued, suddenly recollecting that his wife was
to blame for the whole business. "Now you take the rest
of 'em down, and lay 'em as I told you to."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"And another time you want any oysters, you sit around
in the cellar, and when they open their mouths you put
sticks in. You hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>And Mrs. Spoopendyke took the bivalves back, resolving
that the next time they were in demand they would crawl
out of their shells, and walk up-stairs arm in arm, before
she would have any hand in the mutilation of her poor, dear,
suffering husband by bringing them up herself.</p>

<h2>TAMMY'S PRIZE.</h2>


<p>"Awa' wi' ye, Tammy man, awa' wi' ye to the schule,
aye standin' haverin'," and the old shoemaker looked up
through his tear-dimmed spectacles at his son, who was
standing with his cap on and his book in his hand.</p>

<p>Tammy made a move to the door. "An' is't the truth,
Tammy? and does the maister say't himsel'? Say't ower
again."</p>

<p>The boy turned back, and stood looking on the ground.</p>

<p>"It wasna muckle he said, fayther. He just said, 'It'll
be Tammy Rutherford that'll get the prize i' the coontin.'"</p>

<p>"He said you, did he?" said the old man, as if he had
heard it for the first time, and not for the hundredth.</p>

<p>Again Tammy made a move for the door; and again the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
fond father would have called him back, had not the schoolbell
at that instant rung out loud and clear.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!" said he to himself, after his son had gone, "a
right likely lad, and a credit to his fayther;" and he bent
again to the shoe he was working at, though he could
scarcely see it for the tears that started in his eyes.</p>

<p>The satisfied smile had not worn off his face when the
figure of a stout woman appeared at the door. The shoemaker
took off his spectacles, and wiped them, and then
turned to the new-comer.</p>

<p>"A bra' day till ye, Mistress Knicht. An' hoo'll ye be
keepin'?"</p>

<p>"Oh! brawly, Maister Rutherford. It's the sheen I've come
aboot for my guidman; the auld anes are sare crackit."</p>

<p>"Aweel, mistress, the new anes'll be deen the morn. Set
yersel' doon;" and, complying with this invitation, she sat
down. "An' hoo's yere Sandie gettin' on at the schule,
Mistress Knicht?"</p>

<p>"'Deed, noo ye speak on't, he's a sare loon; he'll niver
look at's lessons."</p>

<p>"He winna be ha'in' ony o' the prizes, I'm thinkin' at
that gate."</p>

<p>"Na, na; he'll niver bother his heed aboot them. But
he's sayin' yer Tam'll ha'e the coontin' prize."</p>

<p>"Ye <em>dinna</em> say sae! Weel, that is news." And he looked
up with ill-concealed pride. "The lad was talkin' o't himsel';
but 'deed I niver thocht on't. But there's nae sayin'."</p>

<p>"Aweel, guid-day to ye; and I'll look in the morn for the
sheen."</p>

<p>"An' are they sayin' Tam'll ha'e a prize?" continued the
old man.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay; the laddie was sayin' sae." And she went
away.</p>

<p>The shoemaker seemed to have fallen on a pleasant train
of thought; for he smiled away to himself, and occasionally
picked up a boot, which he as soon let drop. Visions of
Tammy's future greatness rose before his mind. Perhaps
of too slight a fabric were they built; but he saw Tammy
a great and honored man, and Tammy's father leaning on
his son's greatness....</p>

<p>"Presairve us a'! it's mair nor half-six!" (half-past five.)
And he started up from his revery. "Schule'll hae been
oot an 'oor, an' the laddie's no hame." And he got up, and
moved towards the door. The sun was just sinking behind
the horizon, and the light was dim in the village street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
He put up his hand to his eyes, and peered down in the
direction of the school.</p>

<p>"What in a' the world's airth's keepin' him?" he muttered;
and then turning round he stumbled through the
darkness of his workshop to the little room behind. He
filled an antiquated kettle, and set it on the fire. Then he
went to the cupboard, and brought out half a loaf, some
cheese, a brown teapot, and a mysterious parcel. He placed
these on the table, and then gravely and carefully unrolled
the little parcel, which turned out to be tea.</p>

<p>"Presairve us, I can niver min' whaur ye put the tea, or
hoo muckle. It's an awfu' waicht on the min' to make tea."</p>

<p>His wife had died two years before; and his little son,
with the assistance of a kindly neighbor, had managed to
cook their humble meals. Porridge was their chief fare;
but a cup of tea was taken as a luxury every evening.</p>

<p>"I'm jist some fear't about it. I'll waicht till Tammas
comes in;" and he went out again to the door to see what
news there was of his son.</p>

<p>The sun had completely disappeared now; and the village
would have been quite dark had it not been for the light in
the grocer's window, a few doors down.</p>

<p>The shoemaker leaned against his cottage, and tried to see if
any one were in sight; but not a soul seemed about, although
now and then a sound of laughter was borne up the street.</p>

<p>The door of his next neighbor's house was wide open.
He looked in, and saw a woman standing at the fire, superintending
some cooking operation, with her back to him.</p>

<p>"Is yer Jim in, mistress?"</p>

<p>"Na," she said, without turning her head. "He'll be doon
at some o' his plays. He's nae been in frae the schule yet."</p>

<p>"It's the same wi' Tam. Losh! I'm wunnerin, what's
keepin' him."</p>

<p>"Keepin' him, say ye? What wad keep a laddie?"</p>

<p>Half satisfied, the shoemaker went back to his house, and
found the kettle singing merrily on the fire. He felt a little
anxious. The boy was always home in good time. He
crept round again to his neighbor's.</p>

<p>"I'm gettin' fear't about him," he said: "he's niver been
sae late's this."</p>

<p>"Hoot, awa' wi' ye! he'll be doon, maybe, at the bathin'
wi' the lave, but I'll gang doon the village wi' ye, an' we'll
soon fin' the laddie."</p>

<p>She hastily put her bonnet on her head, for the night air
was cold, and they both stood together outside the cottage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>He clutched her arm. What was that? Through the
still night air, along the dark street, came the sound of
muffled feet and hushed voices, as of those who bore a burden.
With blanched face the old man tried to speak, but
he could not. A fearful thought came upon him....</p>

<p>They are coming nearer. They are stopping and crowding
together, and whispering low. The two listeners crept up
to them; and there in the middle of the group lay Tammy
dead&mdash;drowned.</p>

<p>With a loud shriek, "Tammy, my Tammy!" the old man
fell down beside the body of his son.</p>

<p>They carried both in together into the little room behind
the shop, and went out quietly, leaving one of their number
who volunteered to stay all night.</p>

<p>The shoemaker soon revived. He sat down on one side
of the fire, and the man who watched with him sat on the
other. The kettle was soon on the fire, and he watched its
steam rising with a half-interested indifference. Then at
times he would seem to remember that something had happened;
and he would creep to the side of the bed where the
body lay, and gaze on the straight, handsome features and
the bloodless cheeks, quiet and cold in death. "Tammy,
my man; my ain Tammy, speak to me ance&mdash;jist ance&mdash;I'm
awfu' lonesome-like." Then the watcher would lead
him quietly to his seat by the fire; and there they sat the
whole night long, till the stir of the outer world aroused
them....</p>

<p>The school is filled with happy, pleasant faces. The
prize day has come. There stands the minister, looking
very important, and the schoolmaster very excited. The
prizes are all arranged on a table before the minister, and
the forms for the prize-winners are before the table. And
now every thing is ready. The minister begins by telling
the parents present how he has examined the school, and
found the children quite up to the mark; and then he addresses
a few words to the children, winding up his remarks
by telling them how at school he had thought that "multiplication
is a vexation," &amp;c., but that now he found the use
of it. And then the children laughed, for they heard the
same speech every year; but it made the excitement greater
when they had the prizes to look at, as they shone on the
table in their gorgeous gilding, during the speech. And
now the schoolmaster is going to read out the prize-winners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and the children are almost breathless with excitement,&mdash;you
might have heard a pin drop,&mdash;when from the end of
the room, a figure totters forward, the figure of an old man,
white-headed, and with a strange, glassy look in his eye.
He advances to where the children are sitting, and takes his
place amongst them. Every one looks compassionately
towards him, and women are drying their eyes with their
aprons. The schoolmaster hesitates a moment, and looks at
the minister. The minister nods to him, and he begins the
list. It is with almost a saddened look that the children
come to take their prizes, for they think of the sharp,
bright, active playmate who was so lately with them; and
they gaze timidly towards his father who sits in their midst.</p>

<p>"Thomas Rutherford," reads out the master, "gained the
prize for arithmetic."</p>

<p>"I'll tak' Tam's prize for him. The laddie's na weel.
He's awa'. I'll tak' it;" and the shoemaker moved hastily
up to the table.</p>

<p>The minister handed him the book; and, silently taking
it, he made his way to the door....</p>

<p>A quiet old man moves listlessly about the village. He
does nothing, but every one has a kind word for him. He
never walks towards the river, but shudders when its name
is mentioned. He sits in his workshop often, and looks up
expectantly when he hears the joyous shout of the boys as
they come out of school, and then a look of pain flits across
his face. He has one treasure,&mdash;a book, which he keeps
along with his family Bible, and he is never tired of reading
through his blurred spectacles the words on the first page:&mdash;</p>

<h2>THE SCOTCHMAN AT THE PLAY.</h2>


<p>After paying our money at the door, never while I live
and breathe will I forget what we saw and heard that night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
It just looks to me, by all the world, when I think on it, like
a fairy dream. The place was crowded to the full; Maister
Glen and me having nearly got our ribs dung in before we
found a seat, the folks behind being obliged to mount the
back benches to get a sight. Right to the forehand of us
was a large green curtain, some five or six ells wide, a good
deal the worse of the wear, having seen service through two-three
summers: and just in the front of it were eight or
ten penny candles stuck in a board fastened to the ground,
to let us see the players' feet like, when they came on the
stage; and even before they came on the stage; for, the
curtain being scrimpit in length, we saw legs and sandals
moving behind the scenes very neatly; while two blind
fiddlers they had brought with them played the bonniest ye
ever heard. 'Od! the very music was worth a sixpence of
itself.</p>

<p>The place, as I said before, was choke-full, just to excess;
so that one could scarcely breathe. Indeed, I never saw any
part so crowded, not even at a tent-preaching when the Rev.
Mr. Roarer was giving his discourses on the building of
Solomon's Temple. We were obligated to have the windows
opened for a mouthful of fresh air, the barn being as close
as a baker's oven, my neighbor and me fanning our red
faces with our hats to keep us cool; and, though all were
half stewed, we certainly had the worst of it, the toddy we
had taken having fermented the blood of our bodies into a
perfect fever.</p>

<p>Just at the time that the two blind fiddlers were playing
the "Downfall of Paris" a hand-bell rang, and up goes the
green curtain; being hauled to the ceiling, as I observed
with the tail of my eye, by a birkie at the side, that had
hold of a rope. So, on the music stopping, and all becoming
as still as that you might have heard a pin fall, in comes
a decent old gentleman at his leisure, well powdered, with
an old-fashioned coat on, waistcoat with flap-pockets, brown
breeches with buckles at the knees, and silk stockings with
red gushats on a blue ground. I never saw a man in such
distress: he stamped about, and better stamped about, dadding
the end of his staff on the ground, and imploring all
the powers of heaven and earth to help him to find out his
runaway daughter, that had decamped with some ne'er-do-weel
loon of a half-pay captain, that keppit her in his arms
from her bedroom-window, up two pair of stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Every father and head of a family must have felt for a
man in his situation, thus to be robbed of his dear bairn,
and an only daughter too, as he told us over and over again,
as the salt, salt tears ran gushing down his withered face,
and he aye blew his nose on his clean calendered pocket-napkin.
But, ye know, the thing was absurd to suppose
that we should know any inkling about the matter, having
never seen him or his daughter between the een before, and
not kenning them by headmark: so, though we sympathized
with him, as folks ought to do with a fellow-creature in
affliction, we thought it best to hold our tongues, to see
what might cast up better than he expected. So out he went
stumping at the other side, determined, he said, to find them
out, though he should follow them to the world's end,
Johnny Groat's house, or something to that effect.</p>

<p>Hardly was his back turned, and almost before ye could
cry Jack Robison, in comes the birkie and the very young
lady the old gentleman described, arm-and-arm together,
smoodging and laughing like daft. Dog on it! it was a
shameless piece of business. As true as death, before all
the crowd of folk, he put his arm round her waist, and
called her his sweetheart, and love, and dearie, and darling,
and every thing that is fine. If they had been courting in a
close together on a Friday night, they could not have said
more to one another, or gone greater lengths. I thought
such shame to be an eye-witness to sic on-goings, that I was
obliged at last to hold up my hat before my face, and look
down; though, for all that, the young lad, to be such a
blackguard as his conduct showed, was well enough faured,
and had a good coat to his back, with double gilt buttons
and fashionable lapels, to say little of a very well-made
pair of buckskins, a thought the worse of the wear, to be
sure, but which, if they had been well cleaned, would have
looked almost as good as new. How they had come we
never could learn, as we neither saw chaise nor gig; but,
from his having spurs on his boots, it is more than likely
that they had lighted at the back-door of the barn from a
horse, she riding on a pad behind him, maybe, with her
hand round his waist.</p>

<p>The father looked to be a rich old bool, both from his
manner of speaking, and the rewards he seemed to offer
for the apprehension of his daughter; but, to be sure, when
so many of us were present that had an equal right to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
spullaie, it would not be a great deal, a thousand pounds, when
divided. Still it was worth the looking after: so we just
bidit a wee.</p>

<p>Things were brought to a bearing, howsoever, sooner than
either themselves, I dare say, or anybody else present, seemed
to have the least glimpse of: for, just in the middle of their
fine goings-on, the sound of a coming foot was heard; and
the lassie, taking guilt to her, cried out, "Hide me, hide
me, for the sake of goodness! for yonder comes my old
father!"</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. In he stappit her into a closet;
and, after shutting the door on her, he sat down upon a
chair, pretending to be asleep, in the twinkling of a walking-stick.
The old father came bouncing in; and, seeing the
fellow as sound as a top, he ran forward and gave him such
a shake as if he would have shooken him all sundry; which
soon made him open his eyes as fast as he had steeked
them. After blackguarding the chield at no allowance,
cursing him up hill and down dale, and calling him by
every name but a gentleman, he held his staff over his
crown, and, gripping him by the cuff of the neck, asked him,
in a fierce tone, what he had made of his daughter. Never
since I was born did I ever see such brazen-faced impudence!
The rascal had the brass to say at once, that he had not
seen word or wittens of the lassie for a month, though more
than a hundred folk sitting in his company had beheld him
dauting her with his arm round her jimpy waist not five
minutes before. As a man, as a father, as an elder of our
kirk, my corruption was raised; for I aye hated lying as a
poor cowardly sin, and an inbreak on the Ten Commandments;
and I found my neighbor, Mr. Glen, fidgeting on
the seat as well as me. So I thought that whoever spoke
first would have the best right to be entitled to the reward:
whereupon, just as he was in the act of rising up, I took the
word out of his mouth, saying, "Dinna believe him, auld
gentleman; dinna believe him, friend: he's telling a parcel
of lees. Never saw her for a month! It's no worth
arguing, or calling witnesses: just open that press-door, and
ye'll see whether I'm speaking truth or not!"</p>

<p>The old man stared, and looked dumfoundered; and the
young one, instead of running forward with his double
nieves to strike me, the only thing I was feared for, began
a-laughing, as if I had done him a good turn. But never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
since I had a being did I ever witness such an uproar and
noise as immediately took place. The whole house was so
glad that the scoundrel had been exposed, that they set up
siccan a roar of laughter, and thumped away at siccan a
rate at the boards with their feet, that at long and last, with
pushing and fidgeting, clapping their hands, and holding
their sides, down fell the place they call the gallery, all the
folk in't being hurled topsy-turvy, headforemost, among the
sawdust on the floor below; their guffawing soon being
turned to howling, each one crying louder than another at
the top note of their voices, "Murder! murder! hold off me!
murder! my ribs are in! murder! I'm killed! I'm speechless!"
and other lamentations to that effect: so that a rush
to the door took place, in the which every thing was overturned;
the door-keeper being wheeled away like wildfire;
the furms stramped to pieces; the lights knocked out;
and the two blind fiddlers dung headforemost over the
stage, the bass-fiddle cracking like thunder at every bruise.
Such tearing and swearing, and tumbling and squealing,
was never witnessed in the memory of man since the building
of Babel; legs being likely to be broken, sides staved in,
eyes knocked out, and lives lost,&mdash;there being only one door,
and that a small one: so that, when we had been earned off
our feet that length, my wind was fairly gone; and a sick
dwalm came over me, lights of all manner of colors, red,
blue, green, and orange, dancing before me, that entirely
deprived me of common sense; till, on opening my eyes in
the dark, I found myself leaning with my broadside against
the wall on the opposite side of the close. It was some
time before I minded what had happened: so, dreading
skaith, I found first the one arm, and then the other, to see
if they were broken; syne my head; and finally both of my
legs; but all, as well as I could discover, was skin-whole and
scart-free. On perceiving this, my joy was without bounds,
having a great notion that I had been killed on the spot.
So I reached round my hand very thankfully to take out
my pocket-napkin, to give my brow a wipe, when, lo and
behold! the tail of my Sunday's coat was fairly off and
away, docked by the hainch buttons.</p>

<p>So much for plays and play-actors,&mdash;the first and last, I
trust in grace, that I shall ever see. But indeed I could expect
no better, after the warning that Maister Wiggie had
more than once given us from the pulpit on the subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Instead, therefore, of getting my grand reward for finding
the old man's daughter, the whole covey of them, no better
than a set of swindlers, took leg-bail, and made that very
night a moonlight flitting; and Johnny Hammer, honest
man, that had wrought from sunrise to sunset for two days,
fitting up their place by contract, instead of being well paid
for his trouble, as he deserved, got nothing left him but a
ruckle of his own good deals, all dung to shivers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora.</span> Yourself, Katy, by the blushes on your cheeks
and the sparkle in your eyes. You want me to read it for
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katy.</span> If yees plase, Miss Dora. (<em>Hands letter.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<em>opening letter</em>). I shall learn all your secrets,

<p><span class="smcap">Katy.</span> Thin yees moight shkip the sacrets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<em>laughs</em>). All right, Katy. (<em>Reads.</em>) "Lovely
Katy."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katy.</span> That's me. Sure that's no sacret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<em>reads</em>). "I take me pin in hand wid a bating

<p><span class="smcap">Katy.</span> Yees moight shkip that.</p>

drames of yees, Katy mavourneen."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katy.</span> Sure he's the darlin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<em>reads</em>). "I have yees phortygraff nailed to the
hid uv me bid; and ivery night, afther I've blown out the
candle wid me fingers, I tak a good look at it, an' if ye'll
belave me, there's not a dry thread in me eyes."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katy.</span> Sure he was alwus tinder-hearted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<em>reads</em>). "If yees don't belave me, tak a good look
at yees own face before yees open the lether, and see if I
have not cause to wape."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katy.</span> Sure I ought to have known that before the
lether came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<em>reads</em>). "If yees foind these tinder loins blotted
wid tears, it's all owing to the bad quality uv the ink, which
has compilled me to pin this wid a pincil."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katy.</span> That's no mather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<em>reads</em>). "If yees don't recave this lether, or can't
rade it, niver moind: ye'll know that all that's in it is the
truth, an' nades nather radin' or writin' to till the same.
So name the day, Katy darlin', whin me single blissidniss is
to exphire, an' the mathrimoonial noose shlipped over the
hid of yees lovin' and consolin'</p>

That's all, Katy. (<em>Hands back letter.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katy.</span> It's jist illigant. I'm obleeged to yees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<em>takes shawl from chair</em>). Quite welcome, Katy.
When you get ready to name the day, I'll answer it for you.
But be quick, Katy; for the poor fellow will not live long
on "only his thray males a day, an' his pipe an' tobacyer."
(<em>Runs off</em> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <em>to</em> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katy</span> (<em>looks at letter</em>). Sure it's a darlin' lether, an'
Patsy Dolan's a broth uv a bye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gyp.</span> What's that? Can't read? (<em>Takes letter, and turns

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
